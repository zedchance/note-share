## SQL cont.

### `INSERT`

![image_2021-06-21-10-12-05](/notes/image_2021-06-21-10-12-05.png)

The attributes (`VALUES`) are listed one by one in the same order as when the table was declared.
If they are put in the wrong order the attributes will go into the wrong places (or violate domain constraints).
You can specify the attributes and their order is 

```sql
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE(FNAME, LNAME, SSN, DNO)
    VALUES ('Richard', 'Marini', '1932914921', 4)
```

The attributes that are not null must be specified in the command.
Attributes not supplied will go to their default value (or null if no default specified).

### `DELETE`

![image_2021-06-21-10-16-21](/notes/image_2021-06-21-10-16-21.png)

Examples

```sql
DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
    WHERE LNAME='Brown'
```

Deletes **all** employees who have the last name "Brown".

```sql
DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
    WHERE SSN='123456789'
```

Deletes **all** employees who have the ssn 123456789.

```sql
DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE
```

Since this doesn't have a `WHERE` clause, it is the same as saying `WHERE TRUE`, so **all** employees will be deleted from the table.
The table will still exist (as opposed to `DROP`, where all the tuples would be deleted and the table itself would be deleted).

### `UPDATE`

![image_2021-06-21-10-20-53](/notes/image_2021-06-21-10-20-53.png)

Used to change values in existing tuples.

```sql
UPDATE PROJECT
    SET PLOCATION='Bellaire', DNUM=5
    WHERE PNUMBER=10
```

This will update each location and department number of all projects who have project number 10.

### Queries

![image_2021-06-21-10-24-16](/notes/image_2021-06-21-10-24-16.png)

There are 6 clauses used in SQL queries, we will first talk about these 3.

- `SELECT` takes a list of attributes
- `FROM` takes a list of tables
- `WHERE` takes a condition, a filter

Consider the usual company schema,

![image_2021-06-10-16-56-31](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-56-31.png)
![image_2021-06-21-10-26-24](/notes/image_2021-06-21-10-26-24.png)

1. Retrieve the birthdate and address of the employee whose name is 'John B. Smith'.

    ```sql
    SELECT BDATE, ADDRESS
    FROM EMPLOYEE
    WHERE FNAME='John', AND MINIT='B', AND LNAME='Smith'
    ```

{{< hint info >}}
Note: While relational algebra and relational model is set based, in SQL it is bag based.
So by default a query result is a bag of tuples (duplicates are allowed).
{{< /hint >}}

2. Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the 'Research' department.

    ```sql
    SELECT FNAME, LNAME, ADDRESS
    FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
    WHERE DNUMBER=DNO AND DNAME='Research'
    ```

3. For every project located in 'Stafford', list the project number, the controlling department number, and the department manager's last name, and birthdate.

    {{< hint danger >}}
Include this in the weekly exercise.
    {{< /hint >}}

    ```sql
    SELECT PNUMBER, DNUM, LNAME, BDATE
    FROM PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
    WHERE DNUM=DNUMBER AND
          MGRSSN=SSN AND
          PLOCATION='Stafford'
    ```

### Qualify attribute name

![image_2021-06-21-10-44-09](/notes/image_2021-06-21-10-44-09.png)

If we have ambiguous attribute names we can use the entity name and a dot operator to specify which attributes we need.

For example, since `DNUMBER` is ambiguous when joining department and dept_locations,

```sql
SELECT DNAME, DLOCATION
FROM DEPARTMENT, DEPT_LOCATIONS
WHERE DEPARTMENT.DNUMBER=DEPT_LOCATIONS.DNUMBER
```
