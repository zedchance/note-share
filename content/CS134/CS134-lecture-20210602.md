## DBMS cont.

### Database users

![image_2021-06-02-16-30-56](/notes/image_2021-06-02-16-30-56.png)

If we're storing student information in a database, we'll have fields such as

- age
- birthdate

If we want to store one in the database, which should we pick?
Why only one?

We should choose the birthdate because 
- we can derive the age
- birthdate is also more accurate of a measure of age
- we won't need to increment the age in the database every year

What is the disadvantage of saving both?
- we don't want to waste space when we can derive the age from the birthdate.
- if we save both we have to make sure they are consistent.
In other words: we would have to increment the age on the birthdate.

For end users:
- casual end users: need to use a sophisticated database query language, like SQL
- naive users: use a menu-driven interface
- sophisticated end users: familiar with DBMS to implement their applications

### Data models

![image_2021-06-02-16-41-38](/notes/image_2021-06-02-16-41-38.png)

High level models
- ER, entity-relationship model, best for relational database
- UML

Representational / implementation model
- relational data model, uses relational database
- object data model, O-O, O-R
- network and hierarchical model, uses graph model

### DBMS architecture and data independency

![image_2021-06-02-16-48-52](/notes/image_2021-06-02-16-48-52.png)

At the conceptual schema level, the user doesn't necessarily know the exact implementation of the internal schema level.

### Database languages

![image_2021-06-02-16-51-02](/notes/image_2021-06-02-16-51-02.png)

SQL is a comprehensive integrated language of DDL and DML for relational databases.

## Entity-relationship model

![image_2021-06-02-16-56-12](/notes/image_2021-06-02-16-56-12.png)

{{< hint info >}}
Note: ER diagram notation can change based on different textbooks.
We will use the original notation that is used in our text book.

### Entity and attributes

![image_2021-06-02-16-58-12](/notes/image_2021-06-02-16-58-12.png)

Properties can be used to describe the entity.
For example for a student:

![image_2021-06-02-16-59-55](/notes/image_2021-06-02-16-59-55.png)
![image_2021-06-02-17-00-37](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-00-37.png)
![image_2021-06-02-17-02-41](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-02-41.png)
![image_2021-06-02-17-03-00](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-03-00.png)

On notation:
- entities are in rectangles
- attributes are circled and connected to the entity

![image_2021-06-02-17-04-05](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-04-05.png)

The divisibility of an attribute depends on application.
We can divide address into subparts:

![image_2021-06-02-17-06-19](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-06-19.png)

Here, address is the composite attribute.
Name can also be composite.

![image_2021-06-02-17-08-34](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-08-34.png)

![image_2021-06-02-17-10-50](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-10-50.png)

Students can only have 1 birthdate, but they can have multiple phone numbers.
We can indicate that by a double circle.

![image_2021-06-02-17-11-07](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-11-07.png)

![image_2021-06-02-17-13-37](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-13-37.png)

Since age can be calculated from the birthdate, we can put the age attribute in the ER diagram, but we indicate it can be derived with a dashed line.

### ER diagram notation

![image_2021-06-02-17-18-13](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-18-13.png)

### Keys

![image_2021-06-02-17-18-42](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-18-42.png)

- must be a unique identifier

We underline the attribute name to indicate that it is the key

![image_2021-06-02-17-20-52](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-20-52.png)

If we have an entity called classroom:

![image_2021-06-02-17-23-06](/notes/image_2021-06-02-17-23-06.png)

We can use a composite key of the attributes building and roomNo.

![image_2021-06-02-19-16-30](/notes/image_2021-06-02-19-16-30.png)

Keys must be minimal. 
In other words: adding capacity to the composite key for the classroom model wouldn't add anything beneficial.

### Value sets

### Relationship

![image_2021-06-02-19-33-02](/notes/image_2021-06-02-19-33-02.png)

Relationships are drawn using a diamond.
