## Normalization cont.

We can also use an alternate notation to indicate dependencies:

![image_2021-07-02-09-51-03](/notes/image_2021-07-02-09-51-03.png)
![image_2021-07-02-09-49-40](/notes/image_2021-07-02-09-49-40.png)

If we remove the ssn then the dependency is no longer true.

### Second normal form

![image_2021-07-02-09-57-25](/notes/image_2021-07-02-09-57-25.png)

An attribute that is part of any candidate key is a **prime attribute**.
If we have a relation
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    R(a, b, c, d, e)
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}
and our candidate keys are {{<k>}} \{a,b\} {{</k>}} and {{<k>}} c {{</k>}}, that means our prime attributes are {{<k>}} a,b,c {{</k>}}.

Any attribute that isn't a prime attribute is called an **non-prime attribute**, that is it is not part of any candidate key.
So our non-prime attributes from the last example are {{<k>}} d,e {{</k>}}.

> A relational schema {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} is in **second normal form** if every non-prime attribute {{<k>}} A {{</k>}} in {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} is fully functionally dependent on every key of {{<k>}} R {{</k>}}.

![image_2021-07-02-10-09-26](/notes/image_2021-07-02-10-09-26.png)

- FD1. if we know the `PROPERTY_ID` then we also know the attributes `COUNTY_NAME`, `LOT#`, `AREA`, `PRICE`, `TAX_RATE`
- FD2. if we know the `COUNTY_NAME` and `LOT#`, then we also know the attributes `PROPERTY_ID` `AREA` `PRICE` `TAX_RATE`
- FD3. if we know the `COUNTY_NAME`, then we also know the `TAX_RATE`

So is this in second normal form?

- Our non-prime attributes are `AREA` `PRICE` and `TAX_RATE`, we need to go through and make sure each of these non-prime attributes are fully functional on the keys.
    - Is `AREA` fully functionally dependent on `PROPERTY_ID`?
    {{<k display>}}
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{property id} \to \text{area}
    \end{aligned}
    {{</k>}}
    Yes, because we cannot remove anything from the left hand side and have the dependency hold true.
    (Any attribute that depends on a single key will automatically be fully functionally dependent).
    - The rest of the non-prime attributes are fully functionally dependent on `PROPERTY_ID` for the same reason as above
    - Next we need to check if the non-primes are fully functionally dependent on the key `{COUNTY_NAME, LOT#}`
    {{<k display>}}
    \begin{aligned}
        \{ \text{county name, lot num} \} \to \text{area}
    \end{aligned}
    {{</k>}}
    If we remove `LOT#` will this dependency still hold true?
    Yes, this is fully functionally dependent.
    (If there was another dependency `COUNTY_NAME` {{<k>}} \to {{</k>}} `AREA` then it would still hold true).
    {{<k display>}}
    \begin{aligned}
        \{ \text{county name, lot num} \} \to \text{price}
    \end{aligned}
    {{</k>}}
    This is also fully functionally dependent for the same reason.
    {{<k display>}}
    \begin{aligned}
        \{ \text{county name, lot num} \} \to \text{tax rate}
    \end{aligned}
    {{</k>}}
    This is not fully functionally dependent because if we remove `LOT#`, there still exists a dependency `COUNTY_NAME` {{<k>}} \to {{</k>}} `TAX_RATE` (FD3).
- Therefore, this is **not** in second normal form because non-prime attribute `TAX_RATE` is not fully functionally dependent on key `{COUNTY_NAME, LOT#}`.

{{< hint info >}}
Note: As soon as you find a single non-prime attribute that is not fully functionally dependent on a key you can immediately see it is not in second normal form.

### In class exercise

{{< hint danger >}}
Include this in weekly homework.
{{< /hint >}}

Consider the relation

{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    R(A, B, C, D, E)
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

where the keys are {{<k>}} \{A,B\}, \{C,D\} {{</k>}}, and the dependencies are

{{<k display>}} \{A,B\} \to \{C,D,E\}\\
\{C,D\} \to \{A, B, E\}{{</k>}}

Is {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} in second normal form?

- The non-prime attribute is {{<k>}} E {{</k>}}. So is {{<k>}} E {{</k>}} fully functional on all keys?
    - Is {{<k>}} E {{</k>}} fully functionally dependent on {{<k>}} \{A,B\} {{</k>}}?
    Yes.
    - Is {{<k>}} E {{</k>}} fully functionally dependent on {{<k>}} \{C,D\} {{</k>}}?
    Yes.
- Therefore, {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} is in second normal form.

{{< hint danger >}}
Include this in weekly homework.
{{< /hint >}}

Consider the relation
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    R(A, B, C, D)
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}
with key {{<k>}} \{A,B\} {{</k>}}

![image_2021-07-02-11-35-25](/notes/image_2021-07-02-11-35-25.png)

Is {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} in second normal form?

No, because we can remove {{<k>}} B {{</k>}} from the dependency
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    \{A,B\} \to D
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}
and still fulfill the depdendency via
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    A \to B
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

So, {{<k>}} R  {{</k>}} is not in second normal form.

### Third normal form

Third normal form is easier to check than second normal form.

![image_2021-07-02-11-38-23](/notes/image_2021-07-02-11-38-23.png)

> A relational schema {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} is in **third normal form** if, whenever a non-trivial functional dependency {{<k>}} X \to A {{</k>}} holds in {{<k>}} R {{</k>}}, then either
> - {{<k>}} X {{</k>}} is a superkey of {{<k>}} R {{</k>}}, or
> - {{<k>}} A {{</k>}} is a prime attribute of {{<k>}} R {{</k>}}

{{< hint info >}}
Recall, any key is a superkey:

![image_2021-07-02-11-41-25](/notes/image_2021-07-02-11-41-25.png)
{{< /hint >}}

![image_2021-07-02-11-43-41](/notes/image_2021-07-02-11-43-41.png)

So is this schema in third normal form?

- First we should check to see if FD1 has any violation
    - Check left hand set `{PROPERTY_ID}`:
    Is this a superkey? Yes.
- Check if FD2 has any violation
    - Check left hand set `{COUNTY_NAME, LOT#}`:
    Is this a superkey? Yes.
- Check if FD4 has any violation
    - Check left hand set `{AREA}`:
    Is this a superkey? No.
    - Check right hand set `{PRICE}`:
    Is this a prime attribute? No.
- Therefore, since we had a violation, this schema is **not** in third normal form.

### In class exercise

{{< /hint >}}

![image_2021-07-02-11-55-59](/notes/image_2021-07-02-11-55-59.png)

Is this schema in third normal form?

- Check FD1
    - Left hand set is a superkey, good.
- Check FD2
    - Left hand set is a superkey, good.
- Check FD5
    - Left hand set is not a superkey...
    - Right hand set is a prime attribute, good.
- Therefore, this schema **is** in third normal form.

### Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)

![image_2021-07-02-11-54-43](/notes/image_2021-07-02-11-54-43.png)

This is the highest normal form we will study.

> A relational schema {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} is in **Boyce-Codd Normal Form** (BCNF) if whenever a nontrivial functional dependency {{<k>}} X \to A {{</k>}} holds in {{<k>}} R {{</k>}}, then {{<k>}} X {{</k>}} is a superkey of {{<k>}} R {{</k>}}.

This is a stricter version of the third normal form, it only checks the first condition.

![image_2021-07-02-12-16-02](/notes/image_2021-07-02-12-16-02.png)

Is this schema in BCNF?

- Check FD1
    - Left hand set is a superkey, good.
- Check FD2
    - Left hand set is a superkey, good.
- Check FD5
    - Left hand set is not a superkey.
- Therefore, this schema is **not** in BCNF.

### Normal form examples

If we have the relation
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    R(A, B, C, D, E)
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}
with key {{<k>}} \{A,B\} {{</k>}}, and we have these dependencies:

![image_2021-07-02-12-23-46](/notes/image_2021-07-02-12-23-46.png)

Which normal form is {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} in? Why?

1. Is {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} in BCNF?
    - FD1: left hand set is a superkey? Yes
    - FD2: left hand set is a superkey? No
    - Not in BCNF
2. Is {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} in third normal form?
    - FD1: left hand set is a superkey? Yes
    - FD2: left hand set is a superkey? No.
    Right hand set prime attribute? Yes
    - Passed third normal form checks

Therefore, {{<k>}} R {{</k>}} is in third normal form.

## Storage

Now that we've finished studying implementation, we will look at physical storage.
We will look closer at how a DBMS accesses files on disk.

![image_2021-07-02-12-41-41](/notes/image_2021-07-02-12-41-41.png)

Specific file format meant for read/write by the DBMS.

Moving items when deleting from the middle, ie

![image_2021-07-02-13-10-41](/notes/image_2021-07-02-13-10-41.png)

can be really expensive. So instead we put a marker for deletion in place

![image_2021-07-02-13-11-17](/notes/image_2021-07-02-13-11-17.png)

Once there are a lot of markers in a block, space will have to be reorganized.

![image_2021-07-02-13-08-02](/notes/image_2021-07-02-13-08-02.png)

- This file spans multiple blocks
- It is sorted by name
- If we search based by name, we can use binary search, resulting in {{<k>}} O(\lg n) {{</k>}} time complexity.
- If we search by salary, best we can do is a linear search, resulting in {{<k>}} O(n) {{</k>}} time complexity.
    - If we order by salary, then we could use a binary search.
