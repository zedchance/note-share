### Aliases

![image_2021-06-23-16-39-12](/notes/image_2021-06-23-16-39-12.png)

Aliases are other names for a table.

Consider our normal company schema,

![image_2021-06-10-16-56-31](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-56-31.png)

```sql
SELECT DNAME, L.DLOCATION
FROM DEPARTMENT AS D,
     DEPT_LOCATION AS L
WHERE D.DNUMBER=L.DNUMBER;
```

Here
- `D` is an alias for `DEPARTMENT`
- `L` is an alias for `DEPT_LOCATION`

To make 2 aliases of one entity:

```sql
SELECT E.FNAME, E.LNAME, S.FNAME, S.LNAME
FROM EMPLOYEE AS E, EMPLOYEE AS S
WHERE E.SUPERSSN=S.SSN;
```

{{< hint info >}}
Note: MySQL requires the keyword `AS` for aliases
{{< /hint >}}

![image_2021-06-23-16-52-09](/notes/image_2021-06-23-16-52-09.png)

### Unspecified `WHERE` clause

![image_2021-06-23-16-54-24](/notes/image_2021-06-23-16-54-24.png)

The `WHERE` clause is optional.
Omitting it is the same as `WHERE TRUE`.

![image_2021-06-23-16-55-30](/notes/image_2021-06-23-16-55-30.png)

To emulate a Cartesian product,

```sql
SELECT SSN,DNAME
FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT;
-- no where clause
```

### `*` operator

If we want to view all the columns of a table we can use the `*` operator, ie

```sql
SELECT *
FROM STUDENT;
```

If we want to just see all the tables,

```sql
SHOW TABLES
```

### Use of `DISTINCT`

![image_2021-06-23-16-59-38](/notes/image_2021-06-23-16-59-38.png)

To convert a bag into a set, we can remove all duplicates.
In SQL, we can use the keyword `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate tuples.

```sql
SELECT SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE; -- returns a bag

SELECT DISTINCT SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE; -- returns a set
```

### Set operations

![image_2021-06-23-17-01-15](/notes/image_2021-06-23-17-01-15.png)

`EXCEPT` is the same as set difference.
Note that entities must be union compatible, meaning

- both entities must have the same attributes, and
- both entities attribute's must appear in the same order

{{< hint info >}}
Note:
`UNION ALL`, `EXCEPT ALL`, and `INTERSECT ALL` are bag operations, and need not be studied in 134.
{{< /hint >}}

### `UNION` example

Using our same company schema,

![image_2021-06-10-16-56-31](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-56-31.png)
![image_2021-06-23-17-08-52](/notes/image_2021-06-23-17-08-52.png)

```sql
(SELECT DISTINCT PNUMBER
FROM PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
WHERE DNUM=DNUMBER AND
      MGRSSN=SSN AND
      LNAME='Smith')
UNION
(SELECT DISTINCT PNUMBER
FROM PROJECT, WORKS_ON, EMPLOYEE
WHERE PNUMBER=PNO AND
      ESSN=SSN AND
      LNAME='Smith');
```

- the result is in the union between workers and managers

### Arithmetic operations

![image_2021-06-23-17-21-16](/notes/image_2021-06-23-17-21-16.png)

Show the salary of employees with a 10% raise who work on the ProductX project:

```sql
SELECT FNAME, LNAME, 1.1 * SALARY AS INCREASED_SAL
FROM EMPLOYEE, WORKS_ON, PROJECT
WHERE SSN=ESSN AND
      PNO=PNUMBER AND
      PNAME='ProductX'
```

- this will calculate `1.1 * SALARY` an assign it the alias `INCEASED_SAL`, and it will be a column in the selected table

So are the salaries actually different after the query has been executed?
The answer is no, this is just a temporary calculated column.
`SELECT` is a read operation.

### Substring pattern matching

![image_2021-06-23-17-27-01](/notes/image_2021-06-23-17-27-01.png)

`LIKE` is a powerful operator to do pattern matching.
- The `%` is like a wildcard character
- The `_` is a single character wildcard

### `ORDER BY`

![image_2021-06-23-17-29-32](/notes/image_2021-06-23-17-29-32.png)

A new clause, `ORDER BY` is used to sort the selected tuples.
After a `WHERE` clause you can add a `ORDER BY` clause to specify the sort of the returned table.

```sql
SELECT DNAME, LNAME, FNAME, PNAME
FROM DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE, WORKS_ON, PROJECT
WHERE DNUMBER=DNO AND
      SSN=ESSN AND
      PNO=PNUMBER
ORDER BY DNAME DESC,
         LNAME ASC, 
         FNAME ASC;
```

- `DESC` means descending
- `ASC` means ascending, the default
- the tuples always remains together when being sorted
    - if there is a tie between 2 attributes in `DNAME`, then the tie is broken between `LNAME`
    - if there is a tie in `LNAME`, then the tie is broken between `FNAME`

### Nesting of queries

![image_2021-06-23-17-36-01](/notes/image_2021-06-23-17-36-01.png)

Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the 'Research' department

```sql
SELECT FNAME, LNAME, ADDRESS
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE DNO IN (SELECT DNUMBER
              FROM DEPARTMENT
              WHERE DNAME='Research');
```

The `IN` operator allows nesting of queries.
Notice that the sub query will return a bag of tuples, and the result should be a single attribute, `DNUMBER`.
When the outer `SELECT` is going through tuples, it is going to check if the current tuple's `DNO` is in the bag of tuples returned by the sub query.
