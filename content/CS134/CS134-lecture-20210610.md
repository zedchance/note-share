## Relational model cont.

### Weak entity

![image_2021-06-10-16-10-52](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-10-52.png)
![image_2021-06-10-16-12-22](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-12-22.png)

Notice that the `employee` will be the owner of the depending weak entity.
The primary key will be part of the foreign key and the weak attribute.

![image_2021-06-10-16-15-35](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-15-35.png)

Remember, 

- primary keys are underlined
- foreign keys have arrows pointing to the other reference

### Multivalues attributes

![image_2021-06-10-16-19-07](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-19-07.png)

Consider this ER-diagram,

![image_2021-06-10-16-23-45](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-23-45.png)

We can handle this in our relational model by creating another table called `dept_locations`,

![image_2021-06-10-16-27-37](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-27-37.png)

Note that the primary key of `dept_locations` is the combination of both `dnumber` and `dlocation`.

### A bigger example

Consider

![image_2021-06-10-16-30-13](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-30-13.png)

Its good to start at a strong entity, so we'll start with `employee`

![image_2021-06-10-16-33-42](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-33-42.png)

Then we'll tackle the recursive `supervision` relationship, by creating a foreign key `superssn` that references to the `ssn`,

![image_2021-06-10-16-34-29](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-34-29.png)

Next we'll do `department`

- we need to make `dept_location` to handle the multivalued attribute
- to handle the derived attribute we can either
    1. use a trigger to handle the derived attribute (like `number_of_employees`), (taught in more depth in CS174)
    2. Ignore the derived attributes for now, which is what we'll do

![image_2021-06-10-16-40-22](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-40-22.png)

Now that we have both of those entities setup, we're ready to do the 2 relationships `works_for` and `manages`,

![image_2021-06-10-16-43-23](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-43-23.png)

{{< hint info >}}
Note: The colors don't have any meanings in relational models, just a preference from the Professor.
{{< /hint >}}

Next we need to do the entity `project` before we can do the relationship `controls`

![image_2021-06-10-16-44-52](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-44-52.png)

{{< hint info >}}
Note: The order of your attributes don't have any meaning, you can list `pnumber` first if preferable.
{{< /hint >}}

We need a foreign key in `project` to note which `department` `controls` it

![image_2021-06-10-16-46-51](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-46-51.png)

Next we can add the many-to-many relationship `works_on` with a new table

![image_2021-06-10-16-49-36](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-49-36.png)

- we added the primary key of `works_on` to be both `essn` and `pno`

We can now tackle the weak entity `dependent`

![image_2021-06-10-16-51-46](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-51-46.png)

- we added a foreign key `essn` to reference to the `employee`
- primary key is `essn` and `d_name`

Overall,

## Relational algebra

Studying relational algebra will make our SQL skills better.
It also gives a deeper understanding on how queries are processed.
It is low level algebra presentation of a high level query.

![image_2021-06-10-17-13-43](/notes/image_2021-06-10-17-13-43.png)

Recall that relational model is set based and bag based, so we don't allow duplicates.
It enables users to specify basic retrieval requests.

![image_2021-06-10-17-18-17](/notes/image_2021-06-10-17-18-17.png)

### `SELECT`

![image_2021-06-10-17-18-31](/notes/image_2021-06-10-17-18-31.png)

For example if we're looking for the `employees` from department number 5,

{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    \text{result } \leftarrow \sigma_{\text{dno} = 5}(\text{ employee })
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

and the result it stored.

Consider that result for this table

![image_2021-06-10-17-21-42](/notes/image_2021-06-10-17-21-42.png)

The result `emp_5` will be a new table (though not physically saved on the disk, just as a return result).
For select, the structure of the new relation is the same as the input (this is not true for all operators).

![image_2021-06-10-17-24-47](/notes/image_2021-06-10-17-24-47.png)

So for each given tuple in the input, we are looking to see if it satisfies the condition `dno = 5`,

![image_2021-06-10-17-27-10](/notes/image_2021-06-10-17-27-10.png)

The result is a subset of the tuples.

There can be many conditions in each select operation.
Multiple conditions can be put together with boolean operations.

For example if we want the department of the `employee` to be number 5, with `salary > 30000`

{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    \text{result } \leftarrow \sigma_{\text{dno} = 5 \text{ and salary } > 30000}(\text{ employee })
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

![image_2021-06-10-17-30-43](/notes/image_2021-06-10-17-30-43.png)

2 of the employees are returned (in blue).

We can do more complex selections, ie

{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    \text{result } \leftarrow \sigma_{(\text{dno} = 5 \text{ and salary } > 30000)
    \text{ or } (\text{ dno} = 4 \text{ and salary } > 25000)}(\text{ employee })
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}
