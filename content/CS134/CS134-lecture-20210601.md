{{< columns >}}
Files
- persistent
- on disk
- easy to work with
<--->
DBMS
- needs knowledge of software
- needs to design database structure
- can handle more complex situations
{{< /columns >}}

Imagine we have 2 different files: `student_info` and `grade_record`

Notice the duplication among the 2 files.
This will waste storage if using a normal file system.
There may also be inconsistencies between the 2 files if only 1 is changed.
DBMS can control all of these things for you.
