## SQL cont.

### Aggregate functions cont.

{{< hint danger >}}
Include in weekly assignment.
{{< /hint >}}

List each employee(ssn, fname, lname) who has more than 3 daughters and the salary of the employee is less than 60000.

```sql
SELECT e.ssn, e.fname, e.lname
FROM employee AS e
WHERE e.salary < 60000 AND
      (SELECT COUNT(*)
       FROM dependent AS dep
       WHERE e.ssn=dep.essn AND
             dep.relationship='daughter') > 3;
```

### `GROUP BY` clause

![image_2021-06-28-13-58-35](/notes/image_2021-06-28-13-58-35.png)

A clause `GROUP BY` is used to create sub groups.
This allows us to do some operations within a specific sub group.

The attributes being grouped by must appear in the select clause:

```sql
SELECT x, y
-- from ...
GROUP BY x, y
```

For each department, retrieve the department number, the number of employees in the department, and their average salary.

```sql
SELECT dno, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
FROM employee
GROUP BY dno
```

![image_2021-06-28-14-15-30](/notes/image_2021-06-28-14-15-30.png)

### `HAVING` clause

![image_2021-06-28-14-18-49](/notes/image_2021-06-28-14-18-49.png)

Since the `WHERE` clause comes before the `GROUP BY` clause, if we want to filter the results of the grouping, we can use the `HAVING` clause.
This allows us to filter the results of the grouping by making sure each sub group satisfies the condition after the `HAVING` clause.

- it is okay to have a `GROUP BY` clause without a `HAVING`
- it is **not** okay to have a `HAVING` clause without a `GROUP BY`

For each department which has more than two employees, retrieve the department number, the number of employees in the department, and their average salary.

```sql
SELECT dno, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
FROM employee
GROUP BY dno
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
```

### Summary of SQL queries

![image_2021-06-28-14-17-49](/notes/image_2021-06-28-14-17-49.png)

The optional clauses are surrounded in square brackets `[]`.

### In class exercise

![image_2021-06-10-16-56-31](/notes/image_2021-06-10-16-56-31.png)

Retrieve the department name if the lowest employee salary of the department is greater than 50000.
List department name and lowest salary.

```sql
SELECT dname, MIN(salary)
FROM department, employee
WHERE dno=dnumber
GROUP BY dname
HAVING MIN(salary) > 50000;
```

### Another solution to a previous problem

Our previous problem can be solved using our new clauses:

List each employee(ssn, fname, lname) who has more than 3 daughters and the salary of the employee is less than 60000.

```sql
SELECT ssn, fname, lname
FROM employee, department
WHERE ssn=essn AND
      relationship='daughter' AND
      salary < 60000
GROUP BY ssn, fname, lname
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```

### Returning to earlier problems we skipped

Before we skipped the delete statement with the subquery.

```sql
DELETE FROM employee
WHERE dno IN (SELECT dnumber
              FROM department
              WHERE dname='Research');
```

We can also use a subquery in an `UPDATE`:

```sql
UPDATE employee
SET salary=salary*1.1
WHERE dno IN (SELECT dnumber
              FROM department
              WHERE dname='Research');
```

We can use a subquery in an insert statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dept_info(
    dept_name VARCHAR(10),
    no_of_emps INTEGER,
    total_sal INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO dept_info (dept_name, no_of_emps, total_sal)
    SELECT dname, COUNT(*), SUM(salary)
    FROM department, employee
    WHERE dnumber=dno
    GROUP BY dname;
```

- the result of the subquery will be inserted into the `dept_info` table's values.
