## SQL cont.

### Comparison operators

![image_2021-06-24-16-11-46](/notes/image_2021-06-24-16-11-46.png)

To list all the names of employees whose salary is greater than the salary of all the employees in department 5:

```sql
SELECT e1.lname, e1.fname
FROM employee AS e1
WHERE e1.salary > ALL (SELECT e.salary
                       FROM employee AS e
                       WHERE e.dno=5);
```

- it is *suggested* to use aliases when using nested queries
- if instead our `where` clause was `E1.SALARY > some (...`, it doesn't need to be greater than all items in bag, just some (1 is enough).

### `EXISTS`

![image_2021-06-24-16-28-05](/notes/image_2021-06-24-16-28-05.png)

Often we want to check whether the result of a query is empty.

Retrieve the name of each employee who has a dependent with the same first name as the employee.

```sql
SELECT e.fname, e.lname
FROM employee AS e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT *
              FROM dependent AS d
              WHERE d.essn=e.ssn AND
                    d.dependent_name=e.fname);
```

- if there are any tuples returned by the inner query, the `exists` will return true and the outer query was select the current employee
- the inner query can use the outer query's variables
- we `select *` in the inner query to get the entire table back

Retrieve the names of employees who have no dependents.

```sql
SELECT e.fname, e.lname
FROM employee AS e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
                  FROM dependent AS d
                  WHERE d.essn=e.ssn);
```

### Explicit sets

![image_2021-06-24-16-49-45](/notes/image_2021-06-24-16-49-45.png)

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT essn
FROM works_on
WHERE pno IN (1, 2, 3);
```

- an easy way to explicitly declare a set

### Renaming aliases

### Joined tables

![image_2021-06-24-16-52-35](/notes/image_2021-06-24-16-52-35.png)

```sql
SELECT fname, lname, address
FROM employee JOIN department
    ON dnumber=dno
WHERE dname='Research';
```

- not all DBMS has support for `JOIN`, however MySQL does have support.

![image_2021-06-24-16-56-16](/notes/image_2021-06-24-16-56-16.png)

`JOIN` on its own is the same as `INNER JOIN`.

![image_2021-06-24-16-58-10](/notes/image_2021-06-24-16-58-10.png)

```sql
SELECT fname, lname, dname
FROM employee LEFT OUTER JOIN department
    ON ssn=mgrssn;
```

![image_2021-06-24-16-58-15](/notes/image_2021-06-24-16-58-15.png)

- `INNER JOIN` gets rid of the items that don't match
- `LEFT OUTER JOIN` puts null values for items that don't exist in the left table 
- `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` puts null values for items that don't exist in the right table
- the left and right tables are respective positions: `left JOIN right`

### Aggregation functions

![image_2021-06-24-17-04-09](/notes/image_2021-06-24-17-04-09.png)

Find the maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary among all employees.

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary), MIN(salary), AVG(salary)
FROM employee
```

{{< hint danger >}}

{{< /hint >}}

Find the maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary among employees who work for the 'Research' department.

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary), MIN(salary), AVG(salary)
FROM employee, department
WHERE dno=dnumber AND
      dname='Research';
```

Retrieve the total number of employees in the company.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employee;
```

Consider these 2 queries

```sql
-- amount of different salaries
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary)
FROM employee;

-- amount of all employees with salary
SELECT COUNT(salary)
FROM employee;
```

Retrieve the number of employees in the 'Research' department

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employee, department
WHERE dno=dnumber AND
      dname='Research';
```

Retrieve the names of all employees who have two or more dependents.

```sql
SELECT e.lname, e.fname
FROM employee AS e
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*)
       FROM dependent AS d
       WHERE e.ssn=d.essn) >= 2;
```

- when `COUNT` returns the value, it is a single row/column in a table.
This is a special case where you can compare the table directly to the interger 2.
- you cannot use a comparison in a `SELECT` statement
