## Relational database schemas

![image_2021-06-09-16-36-39](/notes/image_2021-06-09-16-36-39.png)

IC = integrity constraints

Recall, a **state** is a collection of all the instances.

### Example of schema and state

### Valid/invalid state

### Update operations on relations

![image_2021-06-09-16-44-48](/notes/image_2021-06-09-16-44-48.png)

Whenever we do any of these update operations, there is a chance that the constraints may be violated.
These violations may propagate to other tables.

`REJECT` is the most common action taken.
`CASCADE` is also common, but requires setup in DBMS.

![image_2021-06-09-16-50-43](/notes/image_2021-06-09-16-50-43.png)

Respective examples of these are

- Domain constraints are common from type mismatches
- Key constraints happen if you try to insert another tuple with an already used key
- Null values where they aren't allowed
- Null values in a primary key slot
- References to things that don't exist

## ER-to-relational model mapping

This chapter is about going from our ER models to the relational model.

![image_2021-06-09-17-01-15](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-01-15.png)

### Entities

![image_2021-06-09-17-01-24](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-01-24.png)

For example, consider this ER-diagram

![image_2021-06-09-17-04-44](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-04-44.png)

This would be

```
employee(_ssn, salary, fname, minit, lname)
```

as a relational model.
We only use the composite attribute `name` in the conceptual level for semantics.

{{< hint info >}}
Note: There is only one candidate key: `ssn`.
I indicate the key with a leading underscore.
{{< /hint >}}

At this point, it is not case sensitive because we are still at the design level.

Consider this ER-diagram

![image_2021-06-09-17-14-45](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-14-45.png)

This would be

```
classroom(_building, _roomNo, capacity)
```

as a relational model.

{{< hint info >}}
Note on notation: I prepend an underscore on both `building` and `roomNo` to indicate they are a composite key.
Normally they would both be underlined.
{{< /hint >}}

Recall only 1 primary key is allowed per relation.

### Relationships

![image_2021-06-09-17-17-55](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-17-55.png)

Consider this `employee` ER-diagram,

![image_2021-06-09-17-25-40](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-25-40.png)

We will choose the entity with total participation to hold the foreign key,

```
employee(                   _ssn)
                            ^
department(dname, _dnumber, mgrssn)
```

{{< hint info >}}
Note on notation: The foreign key `mgrssn` should have an arrow drawn to `ssn` on `employee`.
I indicate the arrow using the carrot `^`.
{{< /hint >}}

If the relationship itself has a simple attribute, ie

![image_2021-06-09-17-29-35](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-29-35.png)

then the attribute `mgrstartdate` should go in department (the entity with the foreign key).

```
employee(                   _ssn)
                            ^
department(dname, _dnumber, mgrssn, mgrstartdate)
```

![image_2021-06-09-17-18-16](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-18-16.png)

The entity at the many side must include the foreign key to the other.

Consider

![image_2021-06-09-17-36-40](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-36-40.png)


```
employee(_ssn, salary, dno)
                       v
department(dname,      _dnumber)
```

The foreign key `dno` references to the primary key `dnumber`.

If the relationship `works_for` has an attribute, ie

![image_2021-06-09-17-38-46](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-38-46.png)

Then that attribute should also be where the foreign key is, ie

```
employee(_ssn, salary, dno, empstartdate)
                       v
department(dname,      _dnumber)
```

The reason we don't have the `department` reference to the `employee` is because we will have many employees, and the `department` only has 1 foreign key.

![image_2021-06-09-17-18-21](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-18-21.png)
![image_2021-06-09-17-46-21](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-46-21.png)
![image_2021-06-09-17-46-26](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-46-26.png)

![image_2021-06-09-17-18-25](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-18-25.png)
![image_2021-06-09-17-54-59](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-54-59.png)
![image_2021-06-09-17-55-49](/notes/image_2021-06-09-17-55-49.png)

The reason we don't have `employee` have the foreign key for a `project` is because then it wouldn't reflect the many-to-many relationship (an `employee` could only work on 1 project).

### Weak entities
