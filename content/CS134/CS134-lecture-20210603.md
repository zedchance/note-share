## ER model cont.

### Structure constraint cont.

The reason we have both {{<k>}} M {{</k>}} and {{<k>}} N {{</k>}} is because they are are both in the same association.
It is okay to reuse {{<k>}} M {{</k>}} in other places in the diagram.

Note: The double line from `employee` to `works_for` indicates the total participation.

### Weak entity

Entity has
- key
- instance

![image_2021-06-03-17-08-02](/notes/image_2021-06-03-17-08-02.png)

In this diagram, we don't necessarily know what key we should use for the `dependent` entity.
We need to treat `dependent` as a weak entity, indicated by a double box, also note the total participation association.

![image_2021-06-03-17-12-13](/notes/image_2021-06-03-17-12-13.png)

We can use a partial key of the `employee`'s key plus the `dependent`'s name, indicated by a dashed line.

### Attributes of relationship types

{{< hint info >}}
Note: We could optionally have `mgr_start_date` belong to either entity, because it is a 1:1 relationship.
{{< /hint >}}

If one entity, say `department`, has total participation, it is better to have `mgm_start_date` belong to that entity.
(If we had `mgr_start_date` belong to `employee`, then all except 1 `employee`s would have a null attribute, thus it is better to have the `department` hold the attribute.)

![image_2021-06-03-17-32-35](/notes/image_2021-06-03-17-32-35.png)

We have 2 choices for the `emp_start_date` attribute, it can either belong to the `employee` or the `works_for` association.

### Recursive relationships

### Non-binary relationship

![image_2021-06-03-17-40-11](/notes/image_2021-06-03-17-40-11.png)

{{< hint danger >}}
Non-binary relationships will **not** be on exams/assignments.

## In class exercise

{{< hint info >}}
Note: This exercise is not included in the week 1 assignment.
{{< /hint >}}

1. The university keeps track of each student's name (first name, middle name, last name), student number, social security number, permanent address and phone, birthdate, sex, class (e.g. freshman, sophomore, ..., graduate), and degree program (e.g. B.A., B.S., ..., Ph.D.). Some user applications need to refer to the street, city, state, and zip of the student's permanent address, and to the student's last name. Both social security number and student number have unique values for each student.
