- A Karnaugh map is a graphical representation of a logic function. The map for {{< katex >}}n{{< /katex >}}-input logic function is an array with {{< katex >}}2^n{{< /katex >}} cells, (one for each possible input combination).
- To represent a logic function in a k-map, we copy the 1s from the truth table to the corresponding cells.
- Implicants are squares or rectangles made up of minterms
- Pairs of adjacent 1 cells  in the k-map have minterms that differ in ONLY 1 variable
- The minterm pairs can be combined into a single product term using the generalization of theorem T10:
  - `T10) = term`
- Thus, we can use k-maps to simplify the sum of the function.
