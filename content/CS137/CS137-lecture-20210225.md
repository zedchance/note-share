# Multiplexers

An everyday example of a multiplexer is a TV remote.

- Selecting of data or information is a critical function in a digital system and computers.
- A multiplexer (mux for short) is a digital switch. Mux is a circuit used to select and route any of the several inputs to an output signal.
- Mux is a combination circuit, it has the following:
    - {{< katex >}} 2^n {{< /katex >}} inputs
    - {{< katex >}} n {{< /katex >}} control inputs, selector signals
    - one set of output
- For a mux, the value of the control inputs (selector signal) determines the data input that is selected.
- Multiplexer means many into one. A simple example of a non-electronic circuit of a mux is a single pole multiposition switch.
Multi-position switches are widely used in many electronics circuit, however, circuits that operate at high speed require the multiplexer to be automatically selected.
A mechanical switch cannot perform this task satisfactorily.
Therefore, a mux is used to perform high speed switching and are constructed for digital circuits.

`X` and `Y` are inputs, `S` is the selector signal, `r` is the output.

2 to 1 means that it has a total of 2 inputs, with 1 output.
If you called this a "1 bit mux", then each `X` and `Y` would only have one input (0 or 1).

Lets make a truth table of this:

Selector | Input | Input | Output
--- | --- | --- | ---
`S` | `X` | `Y` | `r`
0 | 0 | 0 | 0
0 | 0 | 1 | 1
0 | 1 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 0 | 0
1 | 0 | 1 | 0
1 | 1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 1 | 1

So this is our equation we can simplify:

{{< katex display >}}
\begin{aligned}
    r = \bar{s} \bar{x} y + \bar{s} x y + s x \bar{y} + s x y
\end{aligned}
{{< /katex >}}

Simplifying using a K-map:

![image_2021-02-25-19-45-52](/notes/image_2021-02-25-19-45-52.png)

So, the outputs are selected based on the selector signal.
Outputs, `Y` when `S` = 0; `X` when `S` = 1.

{{< katex display >}}
\begin{aligned}
    r = \bar{s} y + s x
\end{aligned}
{{< /katex >}}
