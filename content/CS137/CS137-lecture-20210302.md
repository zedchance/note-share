# Sequential Circuits 

In combinational circuits, the outputs are only dependent on the inputs.
In sequential circuits, the outputs depend on the inputs, and the previous state of the circuit.

## Core modules

S-R Latches

- Latches are basic building blocks of flip-flops (basic memory unit)
- A 1 bit latch will store 1 bit, 4 bit latch stores 4 bits, and so forth ...
- Two types of memory elements based on the type of trigger that is suitable to operate
- Latches, asynchronous
- Latches operate with an enable signal, which is level sensitive

D flip-flop

- Basic memory storage device
- Block diagram of a D flip flop
- Flip flops, synchronous (the device samples its input based on a common clock)
- Flip flops are edge sensitive
- Doesn't sample an input unless a clock comes in, clock signal needed to change states
- D flip flops is designed using S-R latches
- Similar to S-R latch, only we use set and reset function. (Ties D input to S and NOT D to R).
