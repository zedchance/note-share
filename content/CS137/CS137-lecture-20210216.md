Propagation delay is the time delta between the input and the output.

### Design of a full adder

Carry Propagate Adder (CPA)

- Full adder is an arithmetic logic unit or circuit to add two single digit numbers with Carry-in
- It is still combinational circuit with inputs `Ax` and `Bx`
  - `Sx` is the sum (1 bit)
  - `C-in` carry in
  - `Cx` is the carry out
- Adder is also called Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)
- Fundamental circuit for an adder and has longest propagation delay that is proportional to the number of the carry bits

To estimate the propagation delay of an {{<k>}} n {{</k>}}-bit CPA:

{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \text{ CPA } (n) = \left[ (n-1) \cdot \Delta FA_C \right] + \Delta FA_S
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

`A` | `B` | `S` | `C`
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 1 | 0
1 | 1 | 0 | 1

Lets add 

`A = 0111`
`B = 1111`

`Ai` | `Bi` | `C-in` | `S` | `C-out`
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1
0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1
