Continued from last lecture:

How to convert 5.375 to a floating point representation using IEEE 754:

1. Convert the number to a binary representation
  Start with the whole part: 5 = `101`.
  Then do the fractional part: .375
  Using successive multiplication

    {{< katex display >}}
    \begin{aligned}
      0.375 * 2 = 0 + .75 \\
      0.75 * 2 = 1 + .5 \\ 
      0.5 * 5 = 1 + .0
    \end{aligned}
    {{< /katex >}}

      So .375 = `011`.
      So 5.375 = `101.011` in fixed point

2. Convert the number to scientific notation (move the decimal point over, "normalize")

  {{< katex display >}}
  \begin{aligned}
      101.011 = 1.01011 \cdot 2^2
  \end{aligned}
  {{< /katex >}}

  So we have `1.01011 * 2^2`.
  Our unbiased exponent is `2` and our mantissa is `01011`.

3. Calculate the bias exponent
  Biased offset is 7 because we are using 4 bits to represent the biased exponent.

  {{< katex display >}}
  \begin{aligned}
    \text{unbiased exponent } + \text{ biased offset} &= \text{biased exponent } \\
    2 + 7 &= 9
  \end{aligned}
  {{< /katex >}}

So our biased exponent is 9 = `1001`.

4. Fusion of floating point (put it all together)
  We are using 16 bits to represent our floating point numbers.
  The most significant bit is the sign bit, `0` for positive, `1` for negative.
  Then comes our 4 bit biased exponent.
  Last comes our mantissa, 11 bits set aside for it.
  So,
  `[1 bit sign][4 bit biased exponent][11 bit mantissa]`

    Sign bit | Biased exponent | Mantissa
    --- | --- | ---
    `0` | `1001` | `01011`
  
    So our full number is:
    5.375 = `0100101011000000`
    (pad the right side of the mantissa with zeros until you've used 11 bits.

5. Convert to hex
  `0100 1010 1100 0000` = `0x4AC0`
