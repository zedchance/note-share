# CS137-lecture-20210223

## DeMorgan's Theorem

Theorem 1: {{< katex >}}\neg(x \cdot y) = \neg x + \neg y{{< /katex >}}

Theorem 2: {{< katex >}}\neg(x + y) = \neg x  \cdot \neg y{{< /katex >}}

Steps to convert to all NAND gates:

1. Replace each NOT gate with its equivalent NAND gate.
Connecting the inputs of a NAND gate makes a NOT gate.

2. Place two NOT gates on each of signals going into the final OR.

3. Replace each AND NOT combo with a NAND gate.
