Data is a sequence of bytes in memory, whether we receive it from a file or network.
We will use unsigned int types to avoid sign extension.
These manipulations are powerful in cryptography.

![image_2021-06-04-09-47-08](/notes/image_2021-06-04-09-47-08.png)

We can also move the bits back and forth using left/right shifts.
Bits that shift off the end are gone for good, and 0s are added on the opposite end (in unsigned types).

### Common uses

Rotations are very common in encryption.

![image_2021-06-04-09-59-12](/notes/image_2021-06-04-09-59-12.png)

Here, `(x & 0x000000FF)` is called a mask.
It masks everything except the last 8 bits.

![image_2021-06-04-10-04-26](/notes/image_2021-06-04-10-04-26.png)

On Intel CPUs, the return value is left in `%eax`.

## Array allocation

Auto allocated memory only exists in scope, you can't have long lived memory this way.

![image_2021-06-04-10-12-16](/notes/image_2021-06-04-10-12-16.png)

Remember, `malloc` takes the number of bytes you want, not the number of elements.
If `malloc` is unsuccessful, it will return `0` (`NULL`).

### Reverse array example

![image_2021-06-04-10-16-25](/notes/image_2021-06-04-10-16-25.png)

This could crash if you have less than 400B on the stack available.

This uses {{<k>}} O(n) {{</k>}} space
complexity.

## Inverse techniques in C

### AXR â€“ add, XOR, rotate

We can write an invertible functions using these 3 operations.

- add
- xor
- rotation

Consider something like

```
x = x + y;
```

This can be "undone" via

```
x = x - y;
```

These work with the other operations, i.e.

```
x = x ^ y;
x = x ^ y;      // xor is its own inverse
```

{{< hint info >}}
Note: XOR is associative:

```
(x ^ y) ^ y = x ^ (y ^ y)
```
{{< /hint >}}

Rotation (we'll use `<<<` to indicate left rotate):

```
x = x <<< y;
x = x >>> y;    // or x = x <<< (32 - y)
```

{{< hint info >}}
Note: You can either rotate back, or continue to rotate the entire width.
Here we are assuming that `x` is a 32 bit value
{{< /hint >}}

We can compose these 3 operators to scramble bits (and is invertible):

```c
uint32_t scramble(uint32_t x)
{
    x = x ^ 0x1AFE9B3A; // xor by random constant
    x = x <<< 12;
    x = x + 0x2783AFBC; // add random constant
    return x;
}
```

We could easily write the invertible function to undo these operations:

```c
uint32_t unscramble(uint32_t x)
{
    x = x - 0x2783AFBC; // sub random constant
    x = x >>> 12;
    x = x ^ 0x1AFE9B3A; // xor by random constant
    return x;
}
```

The operations just have to happen in the opposite order of `scramble`.

### Feistel

Another way to write an invertible function in C is to use a Feistel construction.
The idea is that the construction itself is invertible, and not the components.

We can take an input and break it into 2 pieces, and use one half to cause a scrambling of the other half.

An abstract example in C, (here `f` doesn't exist).

```c
// x points to an array of two uint32_t
void fscramble(uint32_t * x)
{
    x[0] = x[0] ^ f(x[1])   // f returns random looking uint32_t
    x[1] = x[1] ^ f(x[0])   // f returns random looking uint32_t
}
```

{{< hint info >}}
Note: Here, `f` is some kind of scrambling function.
{{< /hint >}}

To undo these operations, we just need to do the original operations in reverse order:

```c
// x points to an array of two uint32_t
void funscramble(uint32_t * x)
{
    x[1] = x[1] ^ f(x[0])   // f returns random looking uint32_t
    x[0] = x[0] ^ f(x[1])   // f returns random looking uint32_t
}
```

What is interesting about these Feistel structures, is that `f` itself does NOT need to be invertible.

A concrete example:

```c
// x points to an array of two uint32_t
void fscramble(uint32_t * x)
{
    x[0] = x[0] ^ (x[1] * x[1] + x[1]) // square and add
    x[1] = x[1] ^ (x[0] * x[0] + x[0]) // square and add
}

// x points to an array of two uint32_t
void funscramble(uint32_t * x)
{
    x[1] = x[1] ^ (x[0] * x[0] + x[0]) // square and add
    x[0] = x[0] ^ (x[1] * x[1] + x[1]) // square and add
}
```

## Composing simple ciphers

We will make a simple function that is invertible, but simple to create.
Historically, cryptography uses permutations the most for ciphers.

### Caesar cipher

One of the oldest uses of cryptography was used in Roman times, the Caesar cipher.
They selected a number to be used as a fixed key.
So long as the key wasn't leaked, it provided adequate privacy.

It is a simple shift of the alphabet, so {{<k>}} A \to D, B \to E {{</k>}}, etc.
At the end you wrap around, {{<k>}} Z \to C {{</k>}}.

So if we are encrypting the word `BAD`, and are shifting by 3:

```
B A D
E D G   add 3
B A D   sub 3 to get original
```

This is known as a shift cipher.

```
shift(x):
    ciphertext = x + 3 mod 26
```

We can make this more flexible and more secure by using the key and the character:

```
shift(x, k):
    ciphertext = x + k mod 26
```

So we can get the plaintext by doing the opposite:

```
plaintext = y - k mod 26
          // or
          = y + (26 - k) mod 26
```

This is working in the field {{<k>}} Z_{26} {{</k>}}, meaning we use `mod 26`.

The goal of this is to have the ciphertext and the function to look very random.

So if we encrypt using a key of `k`, and are in the field {{<k>}} Z_5 {{</k>}}.

```
k = 3
encrypt(k, x) = x + k mod 5
```

This is a permutation function, and all it does is add 3 to each of its inputs.

![image_2021-06-04-11-01-34](/notes/image_2021-06-04-11-01-34.png)

This doesn't "look random", as it seems that all of the arrows are parallel.
However, it is secure as long as `k` is picked at random, and we only encrypt a **single** `x`.
Each of the outputs are equally likely, therefore the ciphertext is secure.

Normally however, we don't usually encrypt a single character.
We want our permutation that we are going to use to be more random so we can encrypt more than 1 char at a time.

### Multiplicative cipher

Here instead of using addition (like the shift cipher), we will use multiplication.

So if we are in {{<k>}} Z_{26} {{</k>}}.

{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    e(k,x) &= xk \mod 26 \\
    d(k,y) &= y k^{-1} \mod 26
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

This only works if the multiplicative inverse {{<k>}} k^{-1} {{</k>}} exists in {{<k>}} Z_{26} {{</k>}}.
The inverse of {{<k>}} k {{</k>}} has to be an element in {{<k>}} Z_{26} {{</k>}}, normally people think of fractions as inverses.

Note that not all values in {{<k>}} Z_{26} {{</k>}} have an inverse.

{{<k>}} k^{-1} {{</k>}} exists iff {{<k>}} gcd(k,26) = 1 {{</k>}}.

If {{<k>}} k {{</k>}} and {{<k>}} 26 {{</k>}} share no factors, then it has a multiplicative inverse.

The easiest way to find candidates for {{<k>}} k {{</k>}} is:

1. Go through all of the numbers in {{<k>}} Z_{26} {{</k>}} and throw out
the prime factors that have 26.

So 26 has two prime factors: {{<k>}} 26 = 2 * 13 {{</k>}}.

So we throw out all the ones that have a multiple of 2 or 13, whats left is the numbers that have a multiplicative inverse, i.e.

{{<k display>}} k = 1,3,5,7,9,11,15,17,19,21 {{</k>}}

So lets see how random the multiplicative cipher looks compared to the shift cipher:

If {{<k>}} k = 3 {{</k>}} and {{<k>}} Z_5 \to Z_5 {{</k>}}:

{{<k>}} E(k,x) = kx \mod 5 {{</k>}}

`x` | E(3,x)
--- | ---
0 | 0
1 | 3
2 | 1
3 | 4
4 | 2

![image_2021-06-04-11-17-04](/notes/image_2021-06-04-11-17-04.png)

This looks a lot more random than the shift cipher.
However, it looks like 0 will always map to 0 in a multiplicative cipher.
Also, even though the arrows aren't parallel, they still have some regularity to them.
So we can do better.

### Composing ciphers

{{< hint warning >}}
Principle: Composing simple ciphers of different structures yields a more random looking cipher.
{{< /hint >}}

If we compose 2 invertible functions, the composition will still be invertible.

For example, if we start with a shift cipher, and then use a multiplicative cipher:

![image_2021-06-04-11-22-52](/notes/image_2021-06-04-11-22-52.png)

{{< hint warning >}}
Correction: On right, 2 goes to 2, and 4 goes to 3.
{{< /hint >}}

You need to alternate between different ciphers to add security.
(Composing 2 shifts wouldn't add any additional security than 1).

### Example of a non-linear simple cipher

An example of a non-linear cipher is a transposition cipher.

It considers the data to be in chunks, it doesn't scramble the characters, but rearranges them:

![image_2021-06-04-11-27-51](/notes/image_2021-06-04-11-27-51.png)

It is a simple cipher (because it is reversible), and it is a permutation (domain and codomain are same).
It is non-linear because it cannot be represented by the sum of product terms.

{{< hint info >}}
Connection to AXR operations:
- add is a shift cipher in \\( Z_{2^n} \\)
- xor is a shift cipher in \\( Z_2 \\), for example \\(a \oplus b = a + b \mod 2\\)
- rotate is a transposition.
{{< /hint >}}

We usually don't use multiplication because it is more computationally expensive.
