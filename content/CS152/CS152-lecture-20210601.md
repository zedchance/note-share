## Brief introduction to cryptography

> *Communication in the presence of adversaries*
>
> Ron Rivest

If Alice and Bob want to communicate, the have some kind of medium (like a network connection, or any for of communication).

![image_2021-06-01-12-50-15](/notes/image_2021-06-01-12-50-15.png)

In the midst of the communication medium, there is Eve, the adversary.
Eve can passively attack: reading all the messages that go back and forth.
Our adversary can also do active attacks: modifying the messages, inserting messages, or delete messages.

So we must imagine that our adversary is very powerful. 
If you can secure your communications in the presence of a powerful adversary, then they will also be secure for the weaker.

Eve also has Kerckhoff's law: **the adversary knows everything except secret keys.**
We must assume Eve knows the algorithms being used in the cryptographic process.

### Two kinds of cryptography

{{< columns >}}
Symmetric:
- Alice and Bob share the same secret key
- Much faster (thousands of times faster)
<--->
Asymmetric:
- Alice and Bob each have their own secret key
- Scales better, easier to manage keys among large groups.
Linear as opposed to symmetric's exponential key count.
- More flexible, no trust needed to establish secure connection.
{{< /columns >}}

### What happens in the real world: hybrid cryptography

This is a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.

- Use asymmetric cryptography to start the communication
- Establish a shared secret
- Switch to symmetric for the rest of the communication

### Two main goals

{{< columns >}}
Secrecy
- Adversary should not extract any information
- Verb used: *encrypt/decrypt*
<--->
Authentication
- Receiver is able to verify the data is unaltered and from the sender
- Verb used: *authenticate*, sometimes called MACing (message authentication code)
- In asymmetric: signature
- In symmetric: MAC

## Review of older topics

### Functions and permutations

Cryptography is largely based on invertible functions.
We also need to understand some probability distributions used in cryptography.

For example:

"Let {{<k>}} f:Z_5 \to Z_4 {{</k>}} be a function
..."

Here

- {{<k>}} f {{</k>}} is the name of the function
- {{<k>}} Z_5 {{</k>}} is the domain
- {{<k>}} Z_4 {{</k>}} is the codomain
- The fact that its a function means that every domain element is mapped to 1 codomain element.

{{< hint info >}}
Note: We will define \\( Z_n = \\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\\} \\)
{{< /hint >}}

We will only consider discrete functions in this class.

### Two ways to think of a discrete function

Consider the function {{<k>}} f: Z_5 \to Z_4 {{</k>}}

{{< columns >}}
Arrow diagrams
![image_2021-06-01-14-35-19](/notes/image_2021-06-01-14-35-19.png)
- Every domain element has exactly 1 arrow to the codomain.
- A function is **onto** if each codomain element has at least 1 arrow to it.
- A function is **1-to-1** if each codomain element maps has less than or equal to 1 arrow to it.
- The inverse of the function is if you reverse the arrows. 
Only functions that are onto and 1-to-1 are invertible.
If we reverse the arrows of the above function, we can tell the inverse is **not** a function (multiple arrows coming out of one element).
<--->
Tables

\\( x \\) | \\( f(x) \\)
--- | ---
0 | 1
1 | 0
2 | 2
3 | 3
4 | 3

If this is a function:
- Each domain element appears exactly once in the first column and each element in the second column is in codomain
- For a function to be **onto**: each codomain element appears in the second column
- For a function to be **1-to-1**: no repeats in the second column
- Invertible if both of the above are true: each codomain elements appears exactly once in the second column,
we can see the function is not invertible because 3 appears twice in the second column
{{< /columns >}}

{{< hint warning >}}
Definition: a function is **invertible** if and only if it is 1-to-1 and onto.
{{< /hint >}}

A invertible function's domain and codomain will be sets of the same size.

### Random functions

A random function is one where each element of the codomain (second column) is chosen uniformly at random.

So if we say "let {{<k>}} f: Z_5 \to Z_4 {{</k>}} be random
...", imagine that we have a table defining {{<k>}} f {{</k>}} where the second
column is randomly picked using a random probability (like a coin flip).

{{<k>}} x {{</k>}} | {{<k>}} f(x) {{</k>}}
--- | ---
0 | 3
1 | 3
2 | 2
3 | 2
4 | 3

Random functions are defined randomly, but are then fixed.
So multiple calls to {{<k>}} f(0) {{</k>}} will always return {{<k>}} 3 {{</k>}}.

Sometimes its useful to be lazy when defining a random function, that is to generate the output only on the first call to the input.

#### Examples

What is the probability that {{<k>}} \left[ f(1) = 2 \mid f(0) = 2 \right] {{</k>}}?

If we are filling the table lazily, the probability is {{<k>}} \frac{1}{4} {{</k>}} because the output has not been defined yet.

What is the probabilty that {{<k>}} \left[ f(1) = 2 \mid f(1) = 1 \right] {{</k>}}?

This is {{<k>}} 0 {{</k>}}, because the output has already been defined.

### Permutations

{{< hint info >}}
File: [Permutations functions](/notes/152-permutations.pdf)
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint warning >}}
A **permutation function** is an invertible function where the domain = codomain.
{{< /hint >}}

For example we might say "let {{<k>}} p: Z_4 \to Z_4 {{</k>}} be a random permutation function
..."

{{<k>}} x {{</k>}} | {{<k>}} p(x) {{</k>}}
--- | ---
0 | 1
1 | 3
2 | 0
3 | 2

{{< hint info >}}
Note: the second column above cannot have any repeats because it is invertible.
{{< /hint >}}

The first output generated is uniformly distributed (because nothing is in the table at the beginning).

### Probability

Let {{<k>}} p: Z_4 \to Z_4 {{</k>}} be a random permutation function.
We will use a lazy output table generation:

What is {{<k>}} P(p(1) = 2 \mid p(0) = 1) {{</k>}}?

Answer: {{<k>}} \frac{1}{3} {{</k>}}

What is {{<k>}} P(p(1) = 1 \mid p(0) = 1) {{</k>}}?

Answer: {{<k>}} 0 {{</k>}}

### C memory models

A allocated chunk of memory can be represented by a long rectangle, which could be filled by a network or a file read etc:

![image_2021-06-01-15-23-28](/notes/image_2021-06-01-15-23-28.png)

Left end is the address of the first byte (pointer).
The span of the rectangle is the amount of memory allocated (the length).

Cryptographic functions will be given a buffer like this, and will manipulate the data in the buffer.

### A C programming interface

Lets say we have

```c
void foo(void * p, int nbytes)
```

We use a void pointer `void *` to avoid type warnings.
It is a memory address with no associated type.

Another interface may be:

```c
#include <stdint.h>
void foo(uint8_t * p, int nbytes);
```

`uintN_t`, where `N` is either 8, 16, 32, or 64, each being `N` bits, can be used to specify the size needed.
`uint8_t` is the exact same as `char`, both being the smallest addressable unit (1 byte).

### Accessing memory in C

![image_2021-06-01-15-38-38](/notes/image_2021-06-01-15-38-38.png)

We can access memory randomly via array subscript notation:
- `p[i]` being the `i`th element.
We cannot do this on a `void *`, because it doesn't know the size of each element.
- `p + i` is the address of `p[i]` element, this is pointer arithmetic.

### XOR buffer example

Lets write a function that takes a buffer as input, and returns the XOR of all the bytes.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

uint8_t xor_buf(uint8_t * p, int nbytes)
{
    uint8_t acc = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nbytes; i++)
        acc = acc ^ p[i];
    return acc;
}

int main()
{
    uint8_t buf[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    // at this point memory looks like this in hex:
    // 01 02 03 04
    uint8_t result = xor_buf(buf, 4);
    printf("%x\n", result);
    return 0;
}
```

When we run this we get the output:

```
4
```

which is the expected output.
