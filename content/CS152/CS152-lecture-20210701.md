## Groups

Diffie-Hellman is secure against any passive adversary using groups where the discrete log problem is hard.

A group is a simplification of a field, as it only has 1 operation (instead of 2).

In summary, a group

- is a set of objects (usually numbers) {{<k>}} G {{</k>}}
- has one operation (binary) that is closed, {{<k>}} G \times G \to G {{</k>}}
    - this is usually addition or multiplication
- has an identity
    - usually 0 in an additive group
    - usually 1 in a multiplicative group
- have invereses, {{<k>}} \forall x \in G, \exists y \in G {{</k>}} such
that {{<k>}} x \text{ op } y = \text{identity}   {{</k>}}
- is associative, and commutative

Some examples of infinite groups

- the integers and the addition operator: {{<k>}} (\mathbb{Z} , +) {{</k>}}
    - 0 is identity
    - subtraction is the inverse
- the integers and multiplication is **not** a group, because 0 has no inverse: {{<k>}} (\mathbb{Z} , \times) {{</k>}}
- the rational numbers and multiplication is **not** a group, because 0 has no inverse: {{<k>}} (\mathbb{Q}, \times)  {{</k>}}
    - however its almost a group if it weren't for 0, so if we remove 0 it **is** a group: {{<k>}} (\mathbb{Q} -\{0\}, \times) {{</k>}}

A finite multiplicative group: {{<k>}} (Z^*_n, \times \mod n) {{</k>}}, where {{<k>}} Z^*_n {{</k>}} is the set of all {{<k>}} x \in Z_n {{</k>}} and {{<k>}} \text{gcd} (x,n)=1 {{</k>}}.

To find a group in {{<k>}} Z^*_n {{</k>}}

1. Write all elements of {{<k>}} Z_n {{</k>}}
2. For each prime factor {{<k>}} x {{</k>}} of {{<k>}} n {{</k>}}, cross out all multiples of {{<k>}} x {{</k>}} (including 0).
3. What ever is left is in {{<k>}} Z^*_n {{</k>}}

### Finding a finite multiplicative group

Lets find {{<k>}} Z^*_{12} {{</k>}}.

We know that
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    12 = 2^2 \cdot 3
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

So we can cross out all the multiples of 2 and 3 in our list of numbers:

![image_2021-07-01-09-05-21](/notes/image_2021-07-01-09-05-21.png)

So 
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    Z^*_{12} = \{1,5,7,11\}
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

which forms a multiplicative group {{<k>}} \mod 12 {{</k>}}.

So if we select a pair of these elements and multiple them and take {{<k>}} \mod 12 {{</k>}}, we get another items from the group.
Each element happens to be its own inverse as well (this doesn't always happen, but each element will have an inverse).

We are interested two finite groups that have a hard discrete log problem:

- {{<k>}} Z^*_p {{</k>}} where {{<k>}} p {{</k>}} is prime
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    Z^*_p = \{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}
This is always guaranteed to be a group (0 is thrown out), and it is also a large group (no holes).
The operations is {{<k>}} \times \mod p {{</k>}}.
- The additive elliptic curve group.

### Elliptic curve groups

{{< hint info >}}
- https://wiki.crypto.rub.de/Buch/en/download/Understanding_Cryptography_Chptr_9---ECC.pdf
{{< /hint >}}

- This group is related to geometry (suggested by the name elliptic curve).
Defined by the equation
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \mod p
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}
![image_2021-07-01-09-17-59](/notes/image_2021-07-01-09-17-59.png)
    - The set of objects in the group is all the integer points on the curve.
    - Not all of the points on the line are in the group, only those that have an integer for their {{<k>}} (x,y) {{</k>}} coordinates.
    - The identity is {{<k>}} 0 {{</k>}}
    - The inverse of {{<k>}} (x,y) {{</k>}} is {{<k>}} (x,-y) {{</k>}}
    - The operation is defined as addition
    {{<k display>}}
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{identity} = \text{point} + \text{inverse of point}
    \end{aligned}
    {{</k>}}
    - To add a pair of points, define a secant line that goes through both points (which will be guaranteed to intersect the graph in exactly one other place)
    ![image_2021-07-01-09-24-15](/notes/image_2021-07-01-09-24-15.png)
    This new point is the reflection point, where the result is the inverse of that reflection
    ![image_2021-07-01-09-24-39](/notes/image_2021-07-01-09-24-39.png)
    - If we add a point to itself, define a tangent line that goes through the point, and take the inverse of the reflection point

Elliptic curve groups are good for efficient cryptography because the numbers only have to be 200-500 bits long.

### Facts about groups

> If {{<k>}} G {{</k>}} is a group, and {{<k>}} x \in G {{</k>}}, then {{<k>}} x^{|G|} = 1 {{</k>}}

Recall that {{<k>}} x^i {{</k>}} in a multiplicative group is defined as

{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    x^i = \underbrace{1 \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cdots \cdot x}_{i \text{ times}}
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

and in an additive group it is defined as

{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    x^i = \underbrace{0 + x + x + \cdots + x}_{i \text{ times}}
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

So consider {{<k>}} G = Z^*_7 = \{1, 2, \ldots, 6\} {{</k>}}

- We can raise an item from the group to the size of the group to demonstrate
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    3^6 \mod 7 = 1
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}
- If we list out the powers up to the size of the group power, we get some interesting patterns
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    1^0 &= 1 \\
    2^0 &= 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 1 \\
    3^0 &= 1, 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 2, 3^3 = 6, 3^4 = 4, 3^5 = 5, 3^6 = 1
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}
An element that goes through the entire group before returning to 1 is called a primitive (sometimes called a generator).

> If {{<k>}} G {{</k>}} and {{<k>}} H {{</k>}} are groups that use the same operation, and {{<k>}} H \subseteq G {{</k>}}, then {{<k>}} H {{</k>}} is a subgroup of {{<k>}} G {{</k>}}.

Each of the sets generated in the above example is a sub group (where {{<k>}} 3 {{</k>}} generates the entire group).

So consider {{<k>}} H = \{1,2,4\} {{</k>}}, the set generated by {{<k>}} 2 {{</k>}} in {{<k>}} G {{</k>}} above,

- The same operation is defined in the subgroup: {{<k>}} \times \mod 7 {{</k>}}
- {{<k>}} 1 {{</k>}} is the identity ({{<k>}} 1 {{</k>}} will always be in the subgroup)
- Inverses exist, ie
{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    2 \times 4 \mod 7 = 4 \\
    4 \times 2 \mod 7 = 2
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}
- Therefore, {{<k>}} H {{</k>}} is a subgroup of {{<k>}} G {{</k>}}

> The size of the subgroup that {{<k>}} x {{</k>}} generates is called {{<k>}} x {{</k>}}'s **order**.

So, the order of a primitive element is the full size of the group.
Also, every order divides the size of the group.

So since {{<k>}} |Z^*_7| = 6 {{</k>}}, and the order of 2 is 3, so {{<k>}} 3 | 6 {{</k>}}.

### Diffie-Hellman using elliptic curve groups

If we're doing a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, we can use groups and generators

- group {{<k>}} G {{</k>}}
- generator {{<k>}} g {{</k>}}

Recall that the key exchange is as follows

- Alice chooses {{<k>}} x {{</k>}} where {{<k>}} 0 \leq x < \text{order} (G) {{</k>}}
- Alice sends {{<k>}} g^x {{</k>}} to Bob
    - {{<k>}} g^x {{</k>}} means to apply the group operator {{<k>}} x {{</k>}} times, it may be additive or multiplcative
- Bob chooses {{<k>}} y {{</k>}} where {{<k>}} 0 \leq y < \text{order} (g) {{</k>}}
- Bob sends {{<k>}} g^y {{</k>}} to Alice
- The shared secret is {{<k>}} g^{xy} {{</k>}}

Since the base {{<k>}} g {{</k>}} is known, the secret is basically "how many times was the group operator applied?"

Using elliptic curves (since it is an additive group), the key exchange is as follows

- There is a known point {{<k>}} P = (a,b) {{</k>}}
- Alice chooses {{<k>}} x {{</k>}} where {{<k>}} 0 \leq x < \text{order} (P) {{</k>}}, and sends {{<k>}} xP {{</k>}}
- Bob chooses {{<k>}} y {{</k>}} where {{<k>}} 0 \leq y < \text{order} (P) {{</k>}}, and sends {{<k>}} yP {{</k>}}
- The secret is {{<k>}} xyP {{</k>}}

So how do we multiply an integer and a point?
Recall that we can do exponentiation based on the bit pattern of the exponent with a combination of adding and squaring.
![image_2021-07-01-11-04-09](/notes/image_2021-07-01-11-04-09.png)
Multiplication can be done via a combination of doubling and adding (both defined in an elliptic curve group), based on the bit pattern of the values.

```
mult(a,b):
    let b[1] ... b[n] = b in binary
    acc = 0
    for i from 1 to n:
        acc = acc + acc
        if b[i] = 1
            acc = acc + a
    return acc
```
