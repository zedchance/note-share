Write a recursive Racket function "sum-alternate" that takes a positive integer x as a parameter.
The function should return the sum of all the integers x, x-2, x-4, x-6, etc, as long as the numbers are positive.
For example, `(sum-alternate 5)` should evaluate to 5+3+1, and `(sum-alternate 6)` should evaluate to 6+4+2.

```rkt
(define (sum-acc sum acc)
    (if (<= sum 0)
        acc
        (sum-acc (- sum 2) (+ sum acc))))

(define (sum-alternate sum)
        (sum-acc sum 0))
```

{{< details title="2" open=true >}}

Write a recursive Racket function "sum" that takes two integers as parameters, each greater or equal to zero, and evaluates to their sum.
In this problem, you must use the built-in functions `add1` and `sub1` and may not use the built-in functions "+" or "-".
For example, `(sum 2 3)` should evaluate to 5.
Note: `(add1 5)` evaluates to 6 and `(sub1 4)` evaluates to 3.
Hint: like you saw in the "append" lecture, treat one of the parameters as the size of the problem and recurse until it reaches your base case.

```rkt
(define (sum-acc a b acc)
    (cond ((> a 0) (sum-acc (sub1 a) b (add1 acc)))
          ((> b 0) (sum-acc a (sub1 b) (add1 acc)))
          (else acc)))

(define (sum a b)
        (sum-acc a b 0))
```

Write a recursive Racket function "remove-char" that takes two string parameters, s and c, and evaluates to string s with all occurrences of c removed.
The string c is guaranteed to be a length-1 string; in other words a single character string.
For example `(remove-char "abc" "b")` should evaluate to "ac".
Here is pseudocode that you could implement.

```
if s is empty
   return s
else if (c = first char of s)
   return remove-char(all but first char of s)
else
   return first char of s concatenated with remove-char(all but first char of s)
```

```rkt
(define (remove-char s c)
    (cond ((string=? s "") s)
          ((string=? c (substring s 0 1)) (remove-char (substring s 1) c))
          (else (string-append (substring s 0 1) (remove-char (substring s 1) c)))))
```

{{< details title="4" open=true >}}

Write a recursive Racket function "all-same" that takes a string as a parameter and evaluates to true iff every character in the string is the same.
Note: A string of length 0 or 1 should also evaluate to true.

```rkt
(define (all-same s)
    (cond ((<= (string-length s) 1) #t)
          ((string=? (substring s 0 1) (substring s 1 2)) (all-same (substring s 1)))
          (else #f)))
```
