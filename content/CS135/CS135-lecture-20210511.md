## More reduction examples

Recap on reductions:
A reduction is simply a hypothetical algorithm.

```
ASolver(a)
    ...
    BSolver(...)
    ...
```

`ASolver` relies on the existence of `BSolver`. 
So `ASolver` reduces to `BSolver`.
So if `BSolver` exists, then `ASolver` exists.

### Acceptance problem

If we have an algorithm `accept(m,x)`, we are wondering if we run the algorithm `m` on input `x`, it will either output "accept" or "reject".
The claim is there is no algorithm that can produce this on all inputs `(m,x)`.

The idea of reductions gives us the framework to show that other algorithms cannot exist.

So if we establish that `accept(m,x)` isn't computable on all inputs, then we can also show that subroutines that `accept` may use also don't exist.

```
accept(m,x)
    ...
    subroutine(...)
    ...
```

Since `accept` reduces to `subroutine`, `subroutine` also doesn't exist.

```
accept(m,x):
    construct temporary new program m':
        m'(w):
            if w != x:
                output reject
            else
                output m(x)
    output acceptAny(m')
```

`acceptAny(m')` outputs "accept" if `m'` accepts **any** input.

Lets say that `accept` is running, and it is passed the algorithm `m`, and an input `x`.
The first thing it does is create a new program `m'`.
The new program that is created is passed to `acceptAny`.
If `m'` doesn't accept anything, it outputs reject on almost everything.
The only time that it outputs "accept", is when `m` accepts `x`.
`acceptAny` will be true, if and only if `m` accepts `x`.
So `accept` works only if `acceptAny` works.

## Building and interpreting bf parse trees

We are going to write some Java that parses this grammar:

![image_2021-05-11-11-34-49](/notes/image_2021-05-11-11-34-49.png)

This will be based on our Java parser a couple lectures back.

![image_2021-05-11-12-00-25](/notes/image_2021-05-11-12-00-25.png)

Visualizing the tree for the program:

```bf
[..]
```

This will first follow the production
{{<k>}} S \to LS {{</k>}}

![image_2021-05-11-12-04-20](/notes/image_2021-05-11-12-04-20.png)
![image_2021-05-11-12-04-58](/notes/image_2021-05-11-12-04-58.png)

Then we follow the production {{<k>}} S \to CS {{</k>}}
