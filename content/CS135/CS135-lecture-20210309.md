## Tail recursive sum

![image_2021-03-09-13-25-08](/notes/image_2021-03-09-13-25-08.png)

```rkt
(define (sum xs)
    (if (empty? xs)
        0
        (+ (first xs) (sum (rest xs)))))
```

This isn't tail recursive however.
The recursive call must be the last call in the function.
Lets define it tail recursively, we can use an accumulator:

Invariant: acc + sum of xs is desired answer.

```rkt
(define (sum-helper acc xs)
    (if (empty? xs)
        acc
        (sum-helper (+ acc (first xs)) (rest xs))))

(define (sum xs)
    (sum-helper 0 xs))

(sum '(1 2 3 4))        ; 10
```
