## Functional Programming

Other functions may write to `this.sum`, so this could be incorrect in the future.

Any loop can be turned into a recursively structured function.

### Example of `pow`

```
int pow(int x, int y)
    if (very small)
        solve directly
    else
        solve with smaller_pow
```

So when is exponentiation very small?
This is the base case, where `y = 0`.

```
int pow(int x, int y)
    if (y == 0)
        return 1
    else
        solve with smaller_pow
```

Now we need to figure out the else branch, we know that `x^y = x^(y-1) * x`.

```
int pow(int x, int y)
    if (y == 0)
        return 1
    else
        return x * pow(x, y - 1)
```

## Intro to Racket

racket-lang.org

wescheme.org

Racket is a form of scheme, and scheme is a form of Lisp.

A method definition (which just calls the built-in `sting-append`).

```rkt
(define (my-concat s1 s2)
    (string-append s1 s2))
```

So we can call this function like:

```rkt
(my-concat "abc" "def")     ; "abcdef"
```

Lets define a `strlen` function:

```rkt
(define (strlen s)
    (if (= 0 (string-length s))
        0
        (+ 1 (strlen (substring s 1)))))
```

Yes, this is calling a built in string length function, but its just displaying how a recursively called function is setup.

```rkt
(strlen "")         ; 0
(strlen "a")        ; 1
(strlen "abc")      ; 3
```

## Racket non-list examples

Lists are used a lot as a primary data structure in lisps.

### A factorial function

```rkt
(define (fact n)
    (if (= n 0)
        1
        (* n (fact (-n 1)))))
```

```rkt
(fact 0)        ; 1
(fact 1)        ; 1
(fact 2)        ; 2
(fact 10)       ; 3628800
```

### Fibonacci numbers

We can utilize the `cond` function, used like this:

```rkt
(cond (bool expr)
      (bool expr)
      ...
      (else expr))
```

This is equivalent to a nested if.
`cond` goes one by one and checks each boolean expression, and if true it replaces with `expr`.
The `...` means that there can be any number of expressions to check, this is like a switch.
As soon as it finds the first true it executes the replacement then ends.
At least one thing has to evaluate to true otherwise you'll get a runtime error, so we can end with an else.

```rkt
(define (fib n)
    (cond ((= n 0) 1)
          ((= n 1) 1)
          (else (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2))))))
```

So we can test this:

```rkt
(fib 0)         ; 1
(fib 1)         ; 1
(fib 2)         ; 2
(fib 3)         ; 3
(fib 4)         ; 5
```

### String reverse

If given `"abc"`, it should go to `"cba"`.
To test for string equality we can use built in `string=?`, "*string equal huh?*".
We can use `substring` to cut the string down, and `string-append` to append.
`"cba" = "cb" + "a"`

```rkt
(define (strev s)
    (if (string=? s "")
        s
        (string-append (strev (substring s 1)) (substring s 0 1))))
```

We can test now:

```rkt
(strev "")      ; ""
(strev "a")     ; "a"
(strev "ab")    ; "ba"
(strev "abc")   ; "cba"
```

There is a built in called `check-expect`, which we can use to test.

```rkt
(check-expect (strev "abc") "cba")
```

When you run this, if you see nothing then it works correctly.
If it fails you will see the explanation in the output.

### `writeSequence` problem from practiceit

![image_2021-02-27-12-45-19](/notes/image_2021-02-27-12-45-19.png)

Note that if you call the sequence on 8, the center is the 6 sequence, then you divide 8 but 2 and round up to get the outside number.
We can explicitly change the number to a string with `number->string`.

```rkt
(define (ws n)
    (cond ((= n 1) "1")
          ((= n 2) "11")
          (else (string-append (number->string (ceiling (/ n 2))) (ws (- n 2)) (number->string (ceiling (- n 2)))))))
```

So we can test this to see if its working:

```rkt
(ws 1)          ; "1"
(ws 2)          ; "11"
(ws 3)          ; "212"
(ws 4)          ; "2112"
```

## Racket under the hood

Whenever Racket encounters a `define` in its top down compilation, it stores it in a table.
When it calls a function call, it can be thought of as a constant replacing of definition names with its implementation.
So a functions name gets replaced by its value.
This is easy to think about with single value definitions, like `(define n 1)`, but when a function is defined all the parameters are replaced in the replacement as well.

So if you have this definition:

```rkt
(define (listlen xs)
    (if (empty? xs)
        0
        (= 1 ( listlen (rest xs)))))
```

And you call the function like:

```rkt
(listlen '(1 2 3))
```

`listlen` is actually being replaced with:

```rkt
(if (empty? '(1 2 3))
    0
    (+ 1 (listlen (rest '(1 2 3)))))
```

Which is then replaced by

```rkt
(+ 1 (listlen (rest '(1 2 3))))
```

```rkt
(+ 1 (listlen `(2 3)))
```

and so forth.
