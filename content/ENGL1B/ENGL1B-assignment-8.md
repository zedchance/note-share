- His journalistic exposure led to his view on america
- Whitman wrote poetry that dealt with the world he knew, not normal feudal concepts that were out of reach to most
- Whitman brought in the everyday particulars
- "An American Bard", but to be a bard you needed to see what was really around you, this included the new american world
- He loved american slang, the phrase "so long".
- He tasted the words, the words he used has a physical body
- Couldn't have written _Leaves of Grass_ without italian opera
- He followed great political debates, inspired by the way a politican tries to move a crowd
- "It was the destiny of the United States to democratize the entire world"
- Manifest destiny
- Writes in a persona that makes it so he can write as the American, not as Whitman
- While he presented himself as a "brawler", he was very much quiet
- His poems, and _Leaves of Grass_ were always being re-written
