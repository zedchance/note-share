### NP-Hard

![image_2021-11-29-17-16-28](/notes/image_2021-11-29-17-16-28.png)

- NP-Hard problems are at least as hard as NP-Complete problems

### Why prove NP-completeness?

## Reduction examples

### Directed hamiltonian cycle to undirected hamiltonian cycle

It is easier to go the other way (for any undirected edge, we just make it directed in both directions).

So how do we turn a directed graph into an undirected graph, such that they both either have or have not a hamiltonian cycle?

For each vertex in the directed graph, put 3 vertices in the undirected graph:

![image_2021-12-07-10-22-59](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-22-59.png)

Then, for edges in the directed graph, put an edge from the third vertex to the first in the undirected graph:

![image_2021-12-07-10-24-03](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-24-03.png)
![image_2021-12-07-10-24-52](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-24-52.png)

Now, this particular example does not have a hamiltonian cycle, but lets pretend it does (with the darker color):

![image_2021-12-07-10-26-12](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-26-12.png)

Note that the undirected graph now has the entire perimeter filled in and we can see the hamiltonian cycle.

![image_2021-12-07-10-29-37](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-29-37.png)

The (bold) edges that go from a third vertice to a first vertice represent a hamiltonian cycle in the directed graph.

### The traveling salesman problem

![image_2021-12-07-10-34-29](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-34-29.png)

If we are trying to show that this problem is NP-Complete we need to:

- show that the solution is verifiable in polynomial time
    - with the TSP solution, we can simply sum all of the edges

![image_2021-12-07-10-37-36](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-37-36.png)

We can reduce the Hamiltonian cycle problem to a TSP:

![image_2021-12-07-10-37-50](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-37-50.png)

If we reduce all edge weights to 1, and the TSP gives a result {{<k>}} < n + 1 {{</k>}}, then we have a hamiltonian cycle.
