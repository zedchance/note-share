## More reduction examples

### The SAT problem

One of the first problems to be proved NP-Complete.

![image_2021-12-07-10-43-57](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-43-57.png)

Both parts highlighted in red must be true.
It is easy to make the right side false by setting {{<k>}} x_2 {{</k>}} to false.

![image_2021-12-07-10-44-56](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-44-56.png)

Note that the red circled part cannot be true, and since it is being OR'd we need to make sure that the left side is true.

![image_2021-12-07-10-47-28](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-47-28.png)

So, it is satisfiable.

<blockquote class="book-hint info">
{{<k>}} \to {{</k>}} means "if"

{{<k>}} \leftrightarrow {{</k>}} means "if and only if"
</blockquote>

### Conjunctive normal form

![image_2021-12-07-10-52-26](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-52-26.png)

- if each clause has 3 literals, we call it 3CNF
- similarly for 4

![image_2021-12-07-10-53-06](/notes/image_2021-12-07-10-53-06.png)

Consider a 1CNF:

{{<k display>}}
\begin{aligned}
    x_1 \wedge x_2 \wedge \bar{x_1}
\end{aligned}
{{</k>}}

We can find out if this is satisfiable or not by trying to make each clause true.
Note that {{<k>}} x_1 {{</k>}} creates a contradiction.
So, 1CNF expressions are not NP-Complete.
Similarly for 2CNF.

![image_2021-12-07-11-01-28](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-01-28.png)

- while we don't show the proof here, we can now use the fact that 3CNF is NP-Complete to prove other problems are NP-Complete (by reducing 3CNF to the other problems).

### The clique problem

![image_2021-12-07-11-04-37](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-04-37.png)
![image_2021-12-07-11-06-00](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-06-00.png)
![image_2021-12-07-11-06-22](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-06-22.png)

Lets reduce this instance of a 3CNF problem to an instance of a {{<k>}} k {{</k>}}-clique problem:

We can split each clause up into a group of 3 vertices.
Connect vertices if they are the same boolean value in all clauses.

![image_2021-12-07-11-09-15](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-09-15.png)
![image_2021-12-07-11-09-31](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-09-31.png)
![image_2021-12-07-11-09-48](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-09-48.png)
![image_2021-12-07-11-10-09](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-10-09.png)

So how do we prove that this is a valid reduction?

- the creation of this graph was done in polynomial time
- we need to prove that the answer to the 2 problems are the same
    - if the 3CNF is satisfiable, then at least 1 literal from the clauses is true, which means we would have a {{<k>}} k {{</k>}}-clique in the graph
    - if we have a {{<k>}} k {{</k>}}-clique in the graph, then the 3 vertices of the clique will be from 3 different clauses, and therefore the 3CNF will be satisfiable

### Reducing the clique problem to the vertex cover problem

![image_2021-12-07-11-19-35](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-19-35.png)

Each edge has an endpoint in one of the 3 circled green vertices.

We can check if it has a 1 vertex cover, if no then we can increase the question.
If the graph has 2 vertex cover, then the minimum number is 2 for vertex cover.
At most, we can have {{<k>}} n {{</k>}} vertex cover.

So how can we reduce the clique problem to the vertex cover problem?

![image_2021-12-07-11-26-25](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-26-25.png)
![image_2021-12-07-11-26-40](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-26-40.png)
![image_2021-12-07-11-39-53](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-39-53.png)
![image_2021-12-07-11-40-38](/notes/image_2021-12-07-11-40-38.png)

- the complement of a clique has no edges
- so, any other edge in the graph can be covered by the other vertices not among the clique (there are {{<k>}} n - k {{</k>}} of them).
