## Variable length encoding

If we want to compress a file, we need to represent each symbol with a string of binary digits.
If our strings are variable length, then that means the representation for any symbol should not be the prefix of the representation of another symbol.

### Huffman codes

![image_2021-10-27-16-35-34](/notes/image_2021-10-27-16-35-34.png)

The value at each node is the frequency of symbols in the subtree.
The leaves represent symbols, and each left or right child represents a 0 or 1.
So, if we walk directly to a leaf, the values on each link represent the encoded symbol.

![image_2021-10-27-16-37-21](/notes/image_2021-10-27-16-37-21.png)

So, the above tree shows that `e` is represented as `1101`.

So how can we optimize this tree using a greedy algorithm?
First off, we want the lowest frequency symbols to as low as possible in the tree (lowest frequency items have longer encodings).

![image_2021-10-27-16-40-45](/notes/image_2021-10-27-16-40-45.png)

- {{<k>}} n {{</k>}} is the number of symbols
- creates a heap with frequencies
- each iteration extracts 2 nodes from heap, and inserts a new node that has the sum of frequencies

![image_2021-10-27-16-42-16](/notes/image_2021-10-27-16-42-16.png)
![image_2021-10-27-16-45-44](/notes/image_2021-10-27-16-45-44.png)
![image_2021-10-27-16-48-00](/notes/image_2021-10-27-16-48-00.png)

So how do we prove that this is the optimal binary tree?
We need to prove
- the greedy choice property
- the optimal substructure property

At each point, we are always choosing the 2 lowest frequency symbols. 

![image_2021-10-27-16-52-01](/notes/image_2021-10-27-16-52-01.png)

If during each swap, the subtree frequency does not change, then each tree is optimal.

![image_2021-10-27-16-53-04](/notes/image_2021-10-27-16-53-04.png)

The reason that it is {{<k>}} \geq 0 {{</k>}} is because it will have either lower or the same frequency.

![image_2021-10-27-16-59-29](/notes/image_2021-10-27-16-59-29.png)
![image_2021-10-27-17-02-04](/notes/image_2021-10-27-17-02-04.png)
![image_2021-10-27-17-04-00](/notes/image_2021-10-27-17-04-00.png)

Based on our assumption, we think that {{<k>}} T' {{</k>}} is optimal, whereas {{<k>}} T''' {{</k>}} may not be optimal.
That is why the cost of {{<k>}} T'' {{</k>}} is {{<k>}} \geq  {{</k>}} to {{<k>}} C(T) {{</k>}}.

## Minimum spanning trees

Finding a minimum spanning tree in a graph is also a greedy algorithm.

![image_2021-10-28-10-09-47](/notes/image_2021-10-28-10-09-47.png)

- spanning means it covers every node in the graph
- tree means there is no cycles
- minimum means that the total cost of the tree is the lowest possible

![image_2021-10-28-10-11-13](/notes/image_2021-10-28-10-11-13.png)

- "safe" means that when adding an edge to {{<k>}} A {{</k>}}, it is still a subset of the MST

So how do we find the safe edge?
That leads to different algorithms.

![image_2021-10-28-10-12-22](/notes/image_2021-10-28-10-12-22.png)
![image_2021-10-28-10-13-59](/notes/image_2021-10-28-10-13-59.png)

- an edge that "crosses the cut", means it has 1 endpoint in the first set, and 1 endpoint in the other.

![image_2021-10-28-10-19-46](/notes/image_2021-10-28-10-19-46.png)

- there should be at least 1 edge that crosse the cut, for example {{<k>}} (x,y) {{</k>}}.
- if we remove that edge, and instead add the light edge {{<k>}} (u,v) {{</k>}},
that means that it is the smallest edge that crosses the cut
- this leaves us with another tree, with a total weight that is the same minus {{<k>}} w(x,y) + w(u,v) {{</k>}}

![image_2021-10-28-10-21-42](/notes/image_2021-10-28-10-21-42.png)
![image_2021-10-28-10-26-53](/notes/image_2021-10-28-10-26-53.png)

- "CC" = connected component

### MST algorithms

![image_2021-10-28-10-27-01](/notes/image_2021-10-28-10-27-01.png)

- the algorithm starts by assuming all nodes in the graph are individual connected components (nothing is connected to each other, no nodes in the MST yet)

![image_2021-10-28-10-29-24](/notes/image_2021-10-28-10-29-24.png)
![image_2021-10-28-10-38-10](/notes/image_2021-10-28-10-38-10.png)

- {{<k>}} \pi[r] {{</k>}} represents the "parent of node {{<k>}} r {{</k>}}"
- `extract-min` in a binary heap has a runtime of {{<k>}} O(\lg n) {{</k>}}
- `decrease-key` operation has a complexity of {{<k>}} O(\lg V) {{</k>}}
- the amount of edges in a connected graph is {{<k>}} E = V-1 {{</k>}}, or {{<k>}} \Omega(V) {{</k>}}
- overall runtime complexity of Prim's is {{<k>}} O(E \lg V) {{</k>}}

### Example of Prim's

### Example of Kruskal's

In comparison, Kruskal's starts with all nodes being their own connected components.
It chooses the minimum edge between any 2 connected components:
