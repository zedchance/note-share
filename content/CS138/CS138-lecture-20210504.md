## Review

1. What is the difference between network and transport layer?
Network is machine to machine, transport is process to process

3. Differences between TCP and UDP
TCP is reliable, UDP is not

4. What is multiplex at sender? What is demultiplex at sender?
View slides

5. What is different between UDP socket and TCP socket?
UDP is `SOCK_DGRAM` and TCP is `SOCK_STREAM`, and different respective functions.

6. What is the usual size of UDP header?
8 bytes

7. What is the usual size of IPv4 header?
20 bytes

8. What is the purpose of UDP checksum?
Error detection

9. What is the problem and solution in rdt 2.0, 2.1, 3.0?
View slides

10. For non-pipelined protocols, why does sequence number surface (0,1) suffice?
We only send 1 packet at a time

11. What is the difference between stop-and-wait protocols and pipelined protocols?/
Stop and wait only send 1 packet each time, pipelined send multiple

12. What is cumulative ACK?
Cumulative ACK will confirm success for multiple packets

13. Why does selective repeat have a dilemma when sequence numbers 0,1,2,3 and window size = 3?
View slides

14. For k-bit sequence number, what is the window size for GBN and selective repeat respectively?
GBN is 2^k and selective repeat is 2^(k-1)

15. Name 5 features TCP has that UDP doesn't.
    1. Reliability
    2. flow control
    3. Congestion control
    4. handshake
    5. connection management

16. What is called TCP fast retransmit?
If the sender got triple duplicate it will retransmit

17. Two indicates of data loss.
Count down timer, triple duplicate

18. What is ddefinition of sequence number and ack number for TCP?
View slides

19. Among packet headers, which layer header contains port number?

20. What is diff between TCP flow control and congestion control?
Flow control protects receiver, congestion control protects the network

21. How does receiver advertise free buffer space in TCP header?
View slides.

22.  Why do we need preamble in packet format?
synchronization, or recognize start of new packet

23. 3 costs of congestion
    1. data retranmission due to loss
    2. retransmission due to premature timeout
    3. Network resources allocated to dropped packet

24. Why does TCP have fairness?
Because for all machines involved, each connection will have additive increase multiplicative decrease

25. What is called longest prefix matching?
Selecting the longest matching IP, view slides.

26. IP: What is subset part and host part?
A.B.C.D/X, the a-d is host, x is subnet mask

28. NAT, why can internal computers use private addresses?
The private address is translated on its way out

30. What is the difference between inter-as and intra-as protocols?
Inter is handling tasks between regions, and intra handles only the tasks inside the same region.

31. What is the functionality of inter-as?
Advertise reachability information

32. Hot potatoe routing is to select which router when multiple choices are present

33. What is difference between eBGP and iBGP.
External and internal

34. TDMA is time division, FDMA is frequency division

35. 2 common drawbacks from "taking turns" MAC protocols?
Token based has 1 point of failure, also delay

TRUE/FALSE

1. Multiplexinf occurs at receiver and demultiplexing at sender. FALSE
2. UDP ssocket is identified by 4 tuple: FALSE
3. Checksum can be used to detect transmission error 100% correct. FALSE
4. rdt 3.0 is pipelined: FALSE
5. Stop and wait protocols are better than pipelined: FALSE
6. Selective repeat utilizes cumulative ACK: FALSE
7. GBN has buffers at receivers side: FALSE
9. Forwarding and routing are independent: FASLE
10. Forwarding table uses individual IP addresses as indexes, FALSE
11. Internet is based on datagram network: FALSE
12. IP address if flat: FALSE
13. Like TCP and UDP, ICMP is transport layer: FALSE
14. In tunneling, IPv4 is carried as payload of IPv6: FALSE
15. For broadcasting, innetwork duplicating is betteer than source duplication: TRUE
16. What is called reverse path forwarding based controlled flooding.
17. Data link layer studies logical communication between remote hosts or processes. FALSE
18. Data link layer studies logical communication between hosts or processes: FALSE
19. MAC is hierarchical: FALSE
