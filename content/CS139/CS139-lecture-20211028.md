## Synchronization cont. 

### Weakness of the semaphore

![image_2021-10-28-13-48-14](/notes/image_2021-10-28-13-48-14.png)

### In class exercises

![image_2021-10-28-13-52-49](/notes/image_2021-10-28-13-52-49.png)

- 2 semaphores, 1 mutex semaphore allowing access to laoding zone, and 1 counting semaphore checking if there is a car waiting
- mutex initialized to 1 (unlocked)
- car counting semaphore initialized to {{<k>}} n {{</k>}}

![image_2021-10-28-14-07-02](/notes/image_2021-10-28-14-07-02.png)

- 2 binary semaphores, with ping's semaphore being set to 1 initially, and pong's being set to 0.
- Since we want A to start, it's initial semaphore is set to 1
- Since we want pong to be after, we set its initial semaphore value to 0

Thread A
```
while(1)
    wait(A)
    print "ping"
    signal(B)
```
<--->
Thread B
```
while(1)
    wait(B)
    print "pong"
    signal(A)
```

## Deadlocks

A situation where process sync becomes locked (like when all diners try to grab left chopstick in the philosopher's problem).
A system with limited resources may experience deadlock (if there were enough chopsticks then there wouldn't be deadlock).

![image_2021-10-28-14-23-55](/notes/image_2021-10-28-14-23-55.png)
![image_2021-10-28-14-26-59](/notes/image_2021-10-28-14-26-59.png)

- if thread 1 runs first, it grabs the first mutex
- if there is a context switch, and thread 2 tries to gain mutex, it grab the second mutex
- when thread 1 tries to get second mutex, it will be blocked and have to wait
- both threads are now locked, waiting for each other
- eventually both threads will starve

This really happens because both threads are attempting to gain both mutexs **in opposite order**.
If we visually graph this, you can see it forms a cycle:

![image_2021-10-28-14-31-28](/notes/image_2021-10-28-14-31-28.png)

### Characterization

![image_2021-10-28-14-32-07](/notes/image_2021-10-28-14-32-07.png)

When trying to avoid deadlock, we just need to make 1 of these above conditions false.

### Resource allocation graph

The above graph of the thread 1/2 deadlock was a resource allocation graph.

![image_2021-10-28-14-39-13](/notes/image_2021-10-28-14-39-13.png)

- requests edges can be approved or denied
- an assignment edge represents something that has already happened

![image_2021-10-28-14-39-22](/notes/image_2021-10-28-14-39-22.png)

- request edges point to the entire resource
- assignment (allocation) edges point to the particular instant of the resource
