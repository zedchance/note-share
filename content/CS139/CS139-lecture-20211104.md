## Deadlocks cont

### Banker's algorithm cont.

Recall that the safety subroutine simulates allocating all resources, and if able to if returns true (because it is considered a safe state). 
If it is unable to simulate allocating all resources, it will return false.

The second subroutine of the Banker's algorithm is the resource request:

![image_2021-11-04-13-47-16](/notes/image_2021-11-04-13-47-16.png)

- simulates allocating resource requests by modifying the state of the process
- if safe, the resources can be allocated
- otherwise, it has to wait

### Example using Banker's algorithm

![image_2021-11-04-13-49-51](/notes/image_2021-11-04-13-49-51.png)
![image_2021-11-04-14-00-07](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-00-07.png)

So first we run the safety algorithm:

![image_2021-11-04-14-03-06](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-03-06.png)
![image_2021-11-04-14-04-33](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-04-33.png)
![image_2021-11-04-14-05-55](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-05-55.png)
![image_2021-11-04-14-07-16](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-07-16.png)
![image_2021-11-04-14-08-31](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-08-31.png)

After the initial loop thru all processes, we then go back and check the remaining false finished processes.

![image_2021-11-04-14-10-25](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-10-25.png)
![image_2021-11-04-14-11-45](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-11-45.png)

This returns a safe sequence.
A safe sequence may or may not be unique.

![image_2021-11-04-14-14-26](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-14-26.png)

When {{<k>}} P_1 {{</k>}} requests (1,0,2), the resource request subroutine is called.

![image_2021-11-04-14-18-53](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-18-53.png)

Then, the safety algorithm runs on this new simulated state.
If it returns true, then we can approve this request.
Otherwise, it is denied.

### Deadlock detection

Incase we can't always avoid deadlock, we need a way to detect whether we are in a deadlock state or not.

![image_2021-11-04-14-21-20](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-21-20.png)
![image_2021-11-04-14-21-24](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-21-24.png)
![image_2021-11-04-14-21-29](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-21-29.png)

Once the wait-for graph is built, we can see that there are cycles (2).
However, for multiple instance case, we rely on a variation of the Banker's algorithm.

![image_2021-11-04-14-23-55](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-23-55.png)
![image_2021-11-04-14-24-01](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-24-01.png)
![image_2021-11-04-14-24-48](/notes/image_2021-11-04-14-24-48.png)

- this is the safety algorithm in the detection version
- if any process's `finish[i]` is false, then a deadlock has occured
