### Round robin

Round robin strives on optimizing average response time.

If we make the value of {{<k>}} q {{</k>}} too small, we will have a lot of overhead due to context switches.

### Priority scheduling

Technically, shortest job first is a type of priority scheduling (prioritizing shortest burst time).

### Scheduling in Linux (CFS)

![image_2021-10-05-14-01-18](/notes/image_2021-10-05-14-01-18.png)

Priority levels are 0-139.
- The smaller the prioirity number, the higher the prioirity.
- The higher prioirity processes have larger time quantums.
- Feedback based on sleep time (waiting/idle)
    - longer sleep processes are usually interactive, so we bump up the prioirity (lower value)
    - shorter sleep processes are usually computational process, so we bump the prioirity down (higher value)
- The run queue is 2 arrays of tasks

{{< columns >}}
Real time
- important programs
- priority levels 0-99
<--->
Time sharing
- user programs
- priority levels 100-140
- default is 120
{{< /columns >}}

Picking the next item in the array is constant time.
When we create a process, we add it to the corresponding task list, based on prioirity.

When the active array is exhausted, it is swapped with the expired array.

However, this scheduling algorithm has some problems
- performance of interactive processes can be slow
- fairness issue

Linux's new CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) addresses these problems:

![image_2021-10-05-14-21-47](/notes/image_2021-10-05-14-21-47.png)

- CFS uses a red-black tree for its run queue
- The value that the red-black tree is ordered is called `vruntime`, which is the "virtual run time" that is a function of the run time.

![image_2021-10-05-14-30-02](/notes/image_2021-10-05-14-30-02.png)

- CFS scheduling always picks leftmost node, the smallest value (smallest `vruntime` value)
- periodically address `vruntime` and compare to the leftmost, if it is still smaller we will allow the process to continue to run.
When the `vruntime` surpasses the leftmost in the run queue tree, it will switch to the new smaller value.
(Similar to shortest run time, but we're looking at the history)
- `vruntime` progress rate depends on priority
    - progress rate faster for low priority
    - progress rate slower for high priority
- note that only 1 tree is used, for all priority
