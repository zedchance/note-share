Recall that `vruntime` is a function, not the actual runtime of the process.
The progress rate depends on the priority of the process.

- faster progress rate for low priority process
- slower progress for high priority process

Since we are always looking for the leftmost node in the process run queue, we can maintain a pointer to get the min value in constant time.
Adding a node to a red-black tree can be done in {{<k>}} O(\lg n) {{</k>}} time.

The overall time complexity for the CFS scheduler is {{<k>}} O(\lg n) {{</k>}}.
So this is a slower time complexity than the prior scheduler before CFS, but it is a lot more fair of a scheduler.
