## Concerning the survey from last class

The differences between an array and a linked list:
- Access: arrays can access an spot instantly, linked lists need to iterate from the head until they reach the target.
- Size: arrays are fixed in size, linked lists can become bigger or smaller

Stacks can be implemented using a linked list or an array. FILO

Queues can be implemented using a linked list or a circular array. FIFO

## Recursion

Recursive functions must have a base case, otherwise you will get an infinite loop!

1. f1 has no base case
2. f2 doesn't reduce the problem to the base case (no n - 1)
3. f3 needs to check the base case first
4. f4 recursive call is infinite when n > 0
