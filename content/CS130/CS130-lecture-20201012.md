## Annoucements

Midterm exam on 21, unless pushed back to 26th.

The format is open book, open notes, no webcam. During class time so it will be timed. One question at a time, randomly shuffled, and you can't go back to work on previous questions.

## Radix sort

In this example: D = 3, K = 10. Sort from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.

If we use count sort to sort, our runtime is O(D * (N + K)).

Best case is O(n)
Worst case O(n^2)
Average O(n)

Best/worst case space complexity os O(1)

## Symbol table

When a duplicate is added the value is overwritten. Ordered symbol tables are sorted by key.

key, value
"", 0
"S", 1
"E", 3
"A", 2
"R", 1
"C", 1
"H", 1
"X", 1
"M", 1
"P", 1

When it reaches the "E", it adds 1 to the value. maxFreqKey would be "E".
