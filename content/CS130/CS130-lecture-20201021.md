[MidTermReview.txt](/D5F97D00F95E4565413774A2B7C975AA.txt)

Contents
Everything covered from Module 1 to Module 6

Analysis of algorithm
- Asymptotic notations
- Best-case, average-case, worst-case
- Be able to provide time and space analysis for an given algorithm

Memory of a process
- What are the four sections? (code, data, heap, stack)  What does each section contain?
- Understand function call and stack-based memory allocation

Recursion
- Base case
- Recursive vs. iterative approach, every recursive method can be implemented iteratively
- Consider stack-based memory allocation in space analysis

Sorting Algorithms
- merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, count sort, radix sort
- Sorting algorithm implementation & application, performance analysis and comparison

Data structures
- Binary tree
- Complete binary tree, priority queue, binary max/min heap
- Binary search tree
- Common operations for each data structure and their implementation
- Usages of data structures

Question types
-   Single or Multiple choices
-   Short answer
-   Algorithm analysis (time and space)

Note
-   The best way to prepare for the exam is to review class notes and related sections in the text book, and redo in-class exercises as well as homework questions.
-   The mid-term exam will be open-book and open-notes.
