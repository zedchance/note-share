The first sort method:
- space complexity is O(n)
- running time is 

The second method
- space complexity is O(1)
- running time is O(nlog(n))

An example of a stable sorting algorithm:

Unsorted:
`[3(1), 2, 1, 5, 3(2)]`
(where the (1) indicates that it is the first 3 in the array)

Sorted: 
`[1, 2, 3(1), 3(2), 5]` this is stable
`[1, 2, 3(2), 3(1), 5]` this is unstable

For example if you have two arrays:
`[1, 3, 5]` and `[7, 9, 11]` you can check the last element of the first array against the first element of the second, you can skip the merge.
