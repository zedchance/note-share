C goes to the next open value because they collide

`resize` is called if the table is >= being half full.

The first 8 insertions before the resize:

Put the existing keys (they rehash), then continue putting the rest of the list

A is true
B is false
C is true (another case of A basically)
D is false (another case of B)

For `get`: best case runtime is O(1), worst case is O(n).
For `resize`: avg runtime is O(m).
For `put`: amortized O(1) runtime.

Load factor must be < 1 otherwise it will infinitely loop thru the table on a search miss.

We can't simply set a key to null to delete, becauses if there are keys that hash to that index we won't be able to find it. We start by setting the first key to null, then we have to rehash and reput the keys in the same cluster.
