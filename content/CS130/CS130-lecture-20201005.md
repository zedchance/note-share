With the goal of non-decreasing order.

Sink each parent starting with the last, and working down.

Now to sort, swap last element, reduce heap size, and sink item down

The element at the end will be put into place.

Running time for `sink` is O(lg(n))
Running time for entire `sort` is O(nlg(n)) worst case, best case)

Space complexity for `sink` is O(1)
Space complexity for `sort` is O(1)
