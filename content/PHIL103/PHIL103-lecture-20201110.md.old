# How to be a better person

## How can we manage for better behavior?

- Successful morality interventions need to be based on the correct model of moral psychology.
- The way to induce better behavior depends on how people make decisions.

## Moral psychology

- A study to determine how people (fail to) make moral decisions. _Behavioral ethics_.
- Distinct from _normative ethics_: a study to determine what the moral (i.e., morally right and morally wrong) decision is.

## Behavioral questions

- What motivates good/bad behavior?
- Why do people act badly?
- Why aren't we better?
- (Why aren't we worse?)

## Four models

1. Rational egoists
2. Confused do-gooder
3. Blind spots
4. Weakness of will

## Rational egoist model

- People are smart and selfish
- Smart: rational, effective in taking the most efficient means to secure their end.
- Ends? Their own.
- People act badly when they can 'get away with it."

## How do you get rational egoists to act better?

- Make good behavior pay; make bad behavior costly. Don't subsidize bad behavior.
- Better question: are people rational egoists?
- Consider ultimatum games

## People do have tendencies associated with rational egoists

- Things that effect performance in ultimatum games
  - Meeting the receiver beforehand
  - Seeing the receiver
  - (Perceived) characteristics of the players

## Confused do-gooder model

- People want to do the right thing
- But they're often unsure what that is
- Can't reason their way through the dilemma.

## We just need more ethics training?

- Confused do-gooder model might be based on a false assumption.
- _People will recognize a moral issue or dilema when confronted with it_.
- Can we train people to recognize this?

## Blind spot model

- Wrongdoers aren't aware they're in a dilemma.
- They're unaware of the relevant moral issues that are at stake.
- They go through situations on autopilot.
- The Lake Wobegon Effect

## Weak willed model

- I know its wrong,
- I don't really want to do it, but
- I just can't stop myself.
- Ego depletion: willpower is like a muscle that gets tired from use, and hard to use effectively when its tired.

## Ego depletion experiments

Horrifying real life experiments include favorable positions vs time throughout a day for a judge.

## Another variation

If the subjects were told that the test was supposed to test their own moral will, most subjects wouldn't shock them at all.
