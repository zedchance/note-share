# Why be moral?

Two questions

- Descriptive: would you be moral if you could always get away with immorality?
- Normative: _should_ you be moral if you could always get away with immorality?
- Normativity clarification: this is a rational _should_, not a moral _should_.
- _Is morality rational?_

Rational choice theory

- People have a stable, ordered set of _preferences_.
- Actions have _utility_ insofar as they satisfy these preferences.
- Rational agents always choose the action that has the highest _expected utility_ in light of their _preferences_.

Expected utility

- Discount the value of something by the probability it will occur.
- E.g., you can buy a lottery ticket for \$10. Has a 1% chance of winning \$100, and a 99% chance of winning \$0. Whats the expected utility?
- \((0.01 \cdot 90) + (0.99 \cdot -10))

Is morality (altruism) rational?

- Why does this matter? Why try to show that it can be in our interest to be altruistic?
- Remember, preferences are just given.
- And it turns out that most people are naturally altruistic.
- So, according to rational choice expected utility theory, altruism is rational.

Not a satisfying answer

- Still want to know if its rational to have such preferences in the first place
  - If you could take a pill that would eliminate altruistic ends, would you have reason to do so/not to do so?
  - If you were a sociopath and you could take a pill that would imbue you with altruistic prefernces, would you have a reason to do so/not do so?
  
Prisoner's Dilemma

Imagine you have 2 prisoners, A and B

| | B is silent | B testifies
--- | --- | ---
A is silent | Both get 6 months | A gets 10 years, B goes free
A testifies | A goes free, B gets 10 years | Both get 5 years

Another version

| | Player 2 cooperates | Player 2 defects
--- | --- | ---
Player 1 cooperates | 1: WIN, 2: WIN | 1: LOSE BIG, 2: WIN BIG
Player 1 defects | 1: WIN, 2: LOSE BIG | 1: LOSE, 2: LOSE

Cooperation is a positive-sum, but defection is a dominant strategy

- _Dominant strategy_: a strategy that produces the best results for a player regardless of what other players do
- Other player will either defect or cooperate:
  - If she defects, I do better by defecting
  - If she cooperates, I do better by defecting.
  - So I should always defect.

Connection to morality

- Generally, morality is a positive-sum game.
- Life without morality is a negative sum game.
- But theres always a strong temptation to cheat.
- _Should_ I?

Iterated games

- What if you play PD multiple times with different players who play a wide variety of ways?
- What strategy works best then?

Robert Axelrod's computer simulations

- Best strategy is **tit for tat**.
- Cooperate until the other player defects, then do whatever the other player did last.

Variations: reputation

1. Play one PD round with the person next to you
2. Record total score
3. Hold up whatever card you played (so everyone can see)
4. Find a new player to play with â€“ must agree to play next round.
5. Play another round and record the total score
6. Repeat 3-5
7. One person is randomly selected and paid a tally of their score

An argument that it's rational to be mroal

1. Life is a series of PD interactions, where we have informatino about each other
2. So, "maximize my utility" doesn't maximize your utility.
3. It's better to adopt a credible, public strategy to restrain yourself, provided others do so as well.
4. Therefore, it's rational to internalize a moral code that requires restraint and disposes one to cooperate.
