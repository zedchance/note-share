# Market and government failures

## What is a market failure?

- A (n unregulated) market failed to generate an efficient outcome
- Not all the costs associated with a private transaction are internalized. For example: pollution.
- Or, certain goods/services will tend to be under-provided by the market because of a lack of incentives. For example: a lighthouse.
- An institution failed in some way: the market.

## Typical argument

1. Idealized perfectly competitive economic model of a market would achieve some socially optimal (or Pareto efficient) outcome
2. Real world markets sometimes fail to achieve that outcome: "Market failure!"
3. Government implements a regulatory solution

## Heath's argument

1. Idealized perfectly competitive economic model of a market would achieve some socially optimal (or Pareto efficient) outcome
2. Real world markets sometimes fail to achieve that outcome: "Market failure!"
3. Business have a morally responsibility to act in ways that avoid or correct these inefficiencies.

## Parallel legal argument

- An idealized legal process would achieve the perfectly just outcome
- The real world court system sometimes fails to achieve that outcome "Legal failure!"
- Lawyers (or judges...) have a moral responsibility to act in ways that avoid or correct for these failures.

## Three kinds of rules

1. Recognition rules: rules about the making of rules, rules that rules have to answer to
2. Rules of the game: formal rules of governing "play"
3. Rules _in_ the game: informal rules governing "play"

## Applying the approach

1. The purpose of market interaction is to generate Pareto-efficient (or positive sum) outcomes.
2. Rules that provide for privte ownership and voluntary exchange generally generate Pareto-efficient (or positive sum) outcomes
  But Sometimes they don't! Sometimes there are market failures
3. When they don't do what would generate (or a more) efficient outcome
  A regulatory way to avoid the failure (public intervention, Pigouvian tax, etc). A business-ethical way to avoid the failure ("don't exploit market failures – correct them")

# Failures, market and government (from business ethics to political ethics)

## Thesis

- The market will force firms to be ethical enough
- But there are a lot of cases where corps are able to get away with lying and cheating, and be profitable

## Corporate power and corporate harm

- Where does this power come from?
- How are they able to get away with inflicting harm on, e.g. exmployees, consumers, general public?
- Under what conditions would their power to do this be sustainable?

## Revised thesis

- The market will force firms to be ethical enough UNLESS corps are able to insulate themselves from competitive market pressures

## How?

- Government failure
- Example: government privilege concentrates corporate power, which translates into various social harms

## Examples?

- Martin Shkreli, Turing Pharm
- Bailouts for 956 financial corps
- Regulatory capture: regulatory agencies that are created to "protect people from industry" end up serving the established interests in that industry to the detriment of consumers, potential competitors, and everyone else.

## What is a government failure?

- Government intervention generates an outcome that is less efficient than if they hadn't intervened
- An institution failed in some way: the government itself

## Lesson 1: behavior symmetry

- Market failure, market actors are self-interested and lack complete information
- Interventionist solution? Are political actors morally and informationally perfect?
- Even if particular markets don't meet the standard conditions of perfect competition required to ensure social optimality, government intervention doesn't always make things better. (sometimes it makes things worse)
- Is polotics a Deus Ex Machina, or another tool we have to be careful about how we use?

## Lesson 2

- A market _and government_ failures approach to business ethics
- General moral rule of thumb: do not seek _or distribute/offer_ rents
