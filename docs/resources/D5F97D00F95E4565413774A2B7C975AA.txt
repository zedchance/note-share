                                    Mid-Term Review

Contents
    Everything covered from Module 1 to Module 6

Analysis of algorithm
    Asymptotic notations
    Best-case, average-case, worst-case
    Be able to provide time and space analysis for an given algorithm

Memory of a process
    What are the four sections? (code, data, heap, stack)  What does each section contain?
    Understand function call and stack-based memory allocation

Recursion
    Base case
    Recursive vs. iterative approach, every recursive method can be implemented iteratively
    Consider stack-based memory allocation in space analysis

Sorting Algorithms
    merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, count sort, radix sort
    Sorting algorithm implementation & application, performance analysis and comparison

Data structures
	Binary tree
	Complete binary tree, priority queue, binary max/min heap
  Binary search tree
  Common operations for each data structure and their implementation
  Usages of data structures

Question types
    Single or Multiple choices
    Short answer
    Algorithm analysis (time and space)

Note
    The best way to prepare for the exam is to review class notes and related sections in the text book,
    and redo in-class exercises as well as homework questions.
    The mid-term exam will be open-book and open-notes.
