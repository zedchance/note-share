observe that the `en0` has activity. Double click the card with activity to start packet analyzing.

Hl), Hn = IP address, Ht = port number

Each time the packet goes thru a router, it must go up to the network layer and back down.

At the destination, the layers are removed on the way up to the application layer.

Transport layer: port number
Network layer: IP address
Link layer: MAC address

Most important things about encapsulation:

1. End systems have all the layers, but a switch only has 2 layers, and a router only has 3 layers.
2. On end systems, when packets are generated and sent, headers are added layer by layer. When the packets are received by the final destination, headers will be removed one by one.
3. On switch/routers, the packet will need to go up and down each layer, for error checking or extracting information from headers for routing/forwarding. Some other actions may be taken as well, including the update of link layer header.
