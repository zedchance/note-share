      <description>Problems with RSA #  RSA has some problems, namely
 RSA can be distinguished easily  a black box is either a RSA encryption scheme or random bits it is easy to distinguish between these 2 worlds by sending a 0 bit (or a 1) to the box and see what comes back, and so in the RSA box   \[ \begin{aligned} 0^e = 0 \end{aligned} \]   if we restrict the numbers to large inputs then this becomes better   RSA leaks information  \[\begin{aligned} y_1 = \text{RSA}(x_1) \\ y_2 = \text{RSA}(x_2) \end{aligned}\]  If  \( y_1 = y_2 \)  then  \( x_1 = x_2 \)  .</description>

      <description>Groups #  Diffie-Hellman is secure against any passive adversary using groups where the discrete log problem is hard.
A group is a simplification of a field, as it only has 1 operation (instead of 2).
In summary, a group
 is a set of objects (usually numbers)   \( G \)   has one operation (binary) that is closed,  \( G \times G \to G \)   this is usually addition or multiplication   has an identity  usually 0 in an additive group usually 1 in a multiplicative group   have invereses,  \( \forall x \in G, \exists y \in G \)  such that  \( x \text{ op } y = \text{identity} \)   is associative, and commutative  Some examples of infinite groups</description>
