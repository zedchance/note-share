      <description>Graph basics #  In basic graphs, self loops and multiple edges between vertices are not considered. The number of edges are calculated by
  \[\begin{aligned} |E| = \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \Theta(n^2) \end{aligned}\]  A directed graph is
 strongly connected if there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex in the direction of edges unilaterally connected if for any 2 vertices there is a directed path to and from each vertices weakly connected if there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex, but not in the direction of edges  Representing graphs #  Adjacency lists #  Note: The total length of linked lists for directed graph is less than the total length of linked lists for the undirected graph in this example.</description>
