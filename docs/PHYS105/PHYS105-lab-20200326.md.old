# Centripetal force lab

The string holds the bob, and the entire mechanism spins in a circle to cause the bob to extend outward and hit the tape marker.

Should be percent difference not % error

Write a brief conclusion after the lab. Usually we try to make our experiments have a small percent error, but until now its been hard to tell if it is indeed small. Be familiar with our  numbers, the precision of the instruments. For instant v is measured to the .01cm. Estimate the cumulative error, in other words, if the percent diff is less than 10% then thats pretty good!

This is due Fri at 5p, data is in CANVAS.

Procedure

* Measure the mass of the bob on the digital scale
* Measure the time for 20 revolutions
